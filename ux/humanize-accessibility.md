## Humanize accessibility for your team.

- Cover accessibility and inclusive design issues when conducting user research. Consider the native language, [literacy](http://contentsmagazine.com/articles/the-audience-you-didnt-know-you-had/), digital literacy, and digital access of your users as well as potential visual, hearing, motor, and cognitive disabilities.
- Incorporate accessibility considerations in your personas, user archetypes, or user stories. This could take the form of swapping out [accessibility issues in your personas](https://www.perpendicularangel.com/portfolio/publications/published-on-the-pastry-box/an-alphabet-of-accessibility-issues/) or creating standalone user stories focused on accessibility.
- Help your team learn about the experience of using your product with assistive technology. (Keep in mind that the way a person with a disability uses assistive tools may be very different from your experience of the tools.) This could include:
  - Ask each person on your team to turn off their mouse and trackpad and navigate the product using only their keyboard.
  - Under System Preferences > Accessibility > Display, check the grayscale box and explore your site without color to simulate color blindness.
  - Find an appropriate [empathy prompt](https://empathyprompts.net/#diminished-problem-solving-skills) and walk your team through it.
- When possible, include users with disabilities in user research. During usability testing, make sure to allow them to use their own equipment (which has their own settings already in place).
