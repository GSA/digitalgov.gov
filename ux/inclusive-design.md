## Adopt an [inclusive design](http://inclusivedesignprinciples.org/) mentality.

- Celebrate accessibility requirements as a set of design constraints that help you create a better product for all users.
- Gain a basic understanding of the main categories of disabilities, limitations, or constraints that affect how people use digital services –
  - Vision disabilities – such as blindness and low vision, color blindness,
  - Hearing disabilities – such as deafness and low hearing, tinnitus
  - Motor problems – such as hand tremors, physical deformities or amputations
  - Cognitive disorders – such as dyslexia, dementia, or being sleep deprived
- Understand that almost everyone experiences some type of disability either permanently, temporarily, or situationally. For example: having only one arm is a permanent condition, having an arm in a cast is temporary, and holding a baby in one arm is situational – but in each case you’re restricted to completing tasks with one arm.
- Look for ways that making your product easier to use for folks with disabilities also improves the experience for everyone.
- Design for [progressive enhancement](https://articles.uie.com/progressive_enhancement/) by making sure every person is able to use your product using the most basic technologies, while layering on better experiences for those who can use them.
- When conducting user research, make sure the diversity of your participants reflects the diverse abilities, circumstances, and backgrounds of your actual users.
