question: Have you identified which images are meaningful and which images are decorative in mockups?
personas:
- Carmen’s page didn’t load all the way and didn’t get to download the images. 
- Amanda is blind and uses a braille reader to understand the content of images. 
- John is looking for information with a search engine and needs help being directed to the right content (descriptive alt tags will improve search).

### Steps to take
- Images that are purely decorative shouldn’t be announced by the screenreader, work with your front end designer to make sure they’re coded correctly.
- Images that have meaning should include alt text and possibly a longer description, work with the content designer on your team to create these.
