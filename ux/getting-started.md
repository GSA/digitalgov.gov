## How to use this guide

Accessibility is usability for people who interact with products differently. Your role is to help the team approach accessibility as a facet of user experience rather than checklist of requirements.

If you have project-specific questions, ask the Accessibility Guild in [#g-accessibility](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/g-accessibility/).
