## Guidelines to help teams create accessible and inclusive projects

Accessibility Playbook is a testing tool designed to help teams ensure their web-based content and services are inclusive and comply with [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) of the Rehabilitation Act.

Accessibility Playbook asks testers to answer seven yes-or-no questions regarding a content or service's accessibility. All questions include specific reproduction steps to ensure that accessibility tests are administered consistently. These seven questions are drawn from user research, internal data, and [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).
