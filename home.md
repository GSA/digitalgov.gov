Accessibility Playbook is a testing tool designed to help teams ensure their web-based content and services are accessible and conform to the standards of [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) of the Rehabilitation Act.

The Playbook asks testers to answer seven yes-or-no questions regarding the accessibility of content or a service. All questions include step-by-step instructions on how to check that the content is accessible. These questions are drawn from user research, internal data, and [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) and provide a baseline assessment of web accessibility.
