### Steps to take
- Use sectioning elements to create a broad outline of your page content like `header`, `nav`, `main`, and `footer`. Use content sectioning elements like `section`, `article`, and `aside` to organize the document content into logical pieces.
- You may add `role="banner"` to your masthead and `role="contentinfo"` to your page footer to define what the elements are or do.

<button class="usa-button-secondary">No</button>
<button class="usa-button-outline" type="button">Skip >></button>
