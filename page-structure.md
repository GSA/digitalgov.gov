### Steps to take
- Use sectioning elements to create a broad outline of your page content; examples of these elements include `header`, `nav`, `main`, and `footer`. Use content sectioning elements like `section`, `article`, and `aside` to organize the document content into logical pieces.
- Add `role="banner"` to your masthead and `role="contentinfo"` to your page footer once per page to define landmark elements.
