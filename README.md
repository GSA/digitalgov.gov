## Getting Started for Editors

##### To get set up, you will need:
- GitHub account (free) https://github.com/
- GitHub App for Desktop (free) - https://desktop.github.com/
- Atom — a text/code edtior (free) https://atom.io/
- MAMP (free version) https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/

Install all of these apps on your computer _(assuming you have a Mac OS)_.

#### 1. Set your computer with MAMP
**MAMP** (free version: https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/) sets up your computer to be able to build, edit and run websites locally from your computer so that when you make changes to your project, you can see your changes on your computer well before the rest of the world does.

#### 2. Get set up with Github
Sign-up for a **Github** account https://github.com/ and set up your profile, photos, bios, etc...

Next, install the GitHub App for Desktop (https://desktop.github.com/) and sign in to the app with your Github user/pass.

#### 3. Next, lets install ATOM.
**ATOM** (https://atom.io/) is a free and open-source text editor from Github and it is really simple to use and easy to customize. If you are curious, watch this short intro video on ATOM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5POoGSrtGg
