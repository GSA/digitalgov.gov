## Can you easily access supplementary information clarifying the content?

**Why it’s important**: Gilbert reads at a twelfth-grade level but isn’t familiar with the nuances of a site’s subject matter; to fully understand the site content, he needs easy-to-access contextual information.

### Steps to take
- Consider defining technical or other potentially unfamiliar terms in line; this creates a much more continuous reading experience for the user.
- If you find that you need to define a large number of terms within your content, consider adding a separate glossary page.
- Use hyperlinks or a tooltip rather than footnotes to direct users to definitions. Footnotes can create a jarring reading experience, and they may not render correctly on mobile devices.
