title: "Document Accessibility: Getting From 5,000 to 0"
deck: "**Document Accessibility: Getting From 5,000 to 0**&mdash;Our approach to making 5,000 documents on onrr.gov accessible. We’re steadily making progress towards getting all of our documents 508 compliant. It seemed like an insurmountable challenge, but with a little bit of prioritization and coordination, we’re chipping away at the incompliant debt we had accumulated."
