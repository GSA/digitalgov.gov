title: HHS Leverages Data for Impact and Action at the 2023 Health Datapalooza
deck: U.S. Digital Corps Fellows at HHS proved instrumental to delivering this
  year’s Health Datapalooza, especially the 2023 Health Equity DataJam, which
  launched at the event as a two-month-long technology sprint through the end of
  April. A professional association for health services and policy researchers
  will run the DataJam using HHS open data. Thanks to the U.S. Digital Corps
  Fellows, HealthData.gov includes DataJam challenge prompts, priority themes,
