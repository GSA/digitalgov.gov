title: GSA debuts new search tool to support Native governments and businesses
deck: The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) debuted a new search tool
  that enables buyers to search for Native business categories in GSA
  Advantage!, GSA eBuy, and GSA eLibrary for commercial products and services.
  Tribal governments are limited in their ability to generate traditional
  government revenues because of their unique federal status, and the income
  from Tribal businesses is an important source of development for these
  communities. This new feature will help Native businesses be visible in a
  diverse range of channels where they can sell products and services.
