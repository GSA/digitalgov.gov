:tada: Welcome to the DigitalGov style guide! In our goal to create content that is timely and engaging for our users, we also encourage our writers to use the guidelines below to ensure that there is a consistency to that content.

Below you’ll find guidance for voice and tone, author bios and photos, branding, grammar, images, plain language, inclusive language, and more. For details on _how_ to submit to DigitalGov, visit: _____.

## Voice and Tone

Articles for DigitalGov—written by employees from across the federal government—use an informal, conversational tone. 

### Conscious Inclusivity

Not everyone who uses government services or engages with federal agencies are U.S. citizens. When appropriate, use phrases or words such as: the public, users, people, or folks. 

Additionally, where possible: 

 * Avoid using gendered pronouns; instead, use they or their. 
 * Avoid age-related descriptions of people unless absolutely necessary for the content; in those cases, try using older people or older person—instead of elderly or senior. 

See the **18F Content Guide** for more on inclusive language: https://content-guide.18f.gov/inclusive-language/ 

## Grammar and Spelling

In general, we follow AP Style. Use plain language in your writing for clarity. Avoid using acronyms or jargon that may be unfamiliar to the general public or those outside your agency. 

### Capitalization

Capitalize proper nouns for people, places, and agency names. 

Do not capitalize words like federal, government, or agency unless it is:

 * The first word in a sentence
 * An official title for or name of something
 * In a title or header (we use title case [link to Titles and Headers])

#### Courtesy and Professional Titles

Some old suggestions.

#### Publication Titles

Blogs, magazines, books, etc. are in normal text (i.e., no italics or underlining). Ideally, the titles will be linked to the work that is being referenced.

### Content Titles and Headers

#### Format
We use [title case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Title_case) for for all titles and paragraph headers. Only use end punctuation for headers that pose a question (e.g., What Did We Learn?). If you’re unsure, many free, web-based title case tools use the filters to get AP Style (Examples: [titlecase.com](http://www.titlecase.com) and [capitalizemytitle.com](http://www.capitalizemytitle.com)).

#### Size
Article titles should be set to H1, with any subsequent headers set as H2, H3, and so forth, in hierarchical order. 

Do not use H3 or below to attempt to make the text appear bold; just apply bold formatting to the text with the Formatting Toolbar in Google Docs or Microsoft Word. 

### Numbers, Symbols, Dates, Time, and Places

#### Numbers

- Write out all nine numbers under 10, except for percentages 
- Use the word percent; not the percent sign)

#### Symbols 

Unless the symbol is part of a name or branding, use the word (e.g., use the word and instead of an ampersand & or plus sign +).

#### Dates

- Use the expanded form of Month Day, Year (e.g., February 16, 2018) to avoid confusion that may arise by using the numeric format—for users in some other countries, 01/11/2018 would mean November 1st; not January 11th.
  - For specific dates, use the full, four-digit year 
- Can abbreviate for informal dates (the ‘90s)
- Include ordinal indicators (st, nd, rd, th) on dates (e.g., use November 23rd instead of November 23)

#### Time 

- Time descriptors “ante meridiem” (before noon) and “post meridiem” (after noon) should be abbreviated with lowercase letters as am and pm, respectively. 
- Use the 12-hour clock (8:00 am, 4:00 pm)
- Avoid redundancies, such as, "10 am this morning"
- Seasons (winter, spring, summer, fall, autumn) are not capitalized

#### Places 

- When referring to a number of states, the word “state” should be lowercase (e.g., All 50 states responded.)
- Agency names (jump link to ‘Agency Abbreviations’ below)
- Locations
  - District of Columbia: abbreviate as D.C. in copy, but use the official postal code, DC (without periods), for an address
  - United States: abbreviate as U.S.
  - In copy, spell out state names, such as California. This will help keep naming conventions consistent (while the 2-character abbreviation without periods is the current postal standard for addresses in U.S. states and territories, older versions are still used by some people), and it can help avoid confusion; people often mix up the abbreviation for Louisiana (LA) with the one for Los Angeles (L.A.) 
- Capitalization 

### Agency Abbreviations

#### Initialisms and Acronyms

To avoid confusion, always provide the full name of an agency or program the first time you mention it, followed by its abbreviation (an initialism or acronym) within parentheses. You can then use just the abbreviation elsewhere in the copy. Example: 

> _Lorem ipsum National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat._ 
> 
> _Duis aute irure dolor NASA in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum._

**Initialism examples**: 

OMG, LOL, BIA, GSA, FBI, OPM, SEO, CMS, HTML, CSS 

**Acronym examples (an initialism is used as a word)**: 

scuba, laser, radar, WYSIWYG, WCAG, NASA, OPEC, NARA, DARPA, INTERPOL, NATO, FEMA, SWAT

[link to list of agency names and abbreviations]

**_Note_**: Avoid redundancies, such as, “ATM machine” (automated teller machine machine) and “PIN number” (personal identification number number).

##### Pluralization
There is no need to add an s to the end of an initialism or acronym if a word in the original name is already plural. 

Use **CoE** for Centers of Excellence. Adding an _s_ on the end—CoEs—would actually mean, _Centers of Excellences_. 

## DigitalGov Branding 

While the website URL is digitalgov.gov, always use medial capitals (camel case) to refer to our name; DigitalGov. 

### Branded names and initialisms or acronyms for related services and programs: 

- **[Digital Analytics Program](https://www.digital.gov/dap/)** (DAP)  
  - DAP’s dashboard website domain and name are the same: [analytics.usa.gov](https://analytics.usa.gov) 
- **DigitalGov Search** was renamed: **[Search.gov](https://www.digital.gov/services/search/)** 
- **[DigitalGov University](https://www.digital.gov/digitalgov-university/)** (DGU) 
- **[Emerging Citizen Technology Office](https://emerging.digital.gov/)** (ECTO)
- **[Federal CrowdSource Mobile Testing Program](https://www.digital.gov/services/mobile-application-testing-program/)** (no acronym)
- **[U.S. Digital Registry](https://www.digital.gov/services/u-s-digital-registry/)** (no acronym; replaced the Federal Social Media Registry and the Federal Mobile Products Registry)
- **U.S. Web Design Standards** was renamed: **[U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/)** (USWDS)

Additionally, we often abbreviate Community of Practice as CoP, and we have [over 20 communities](https://digital.gov/communities/) listed on DigitalGov. However, they are run by federal employees at agencies across the federal government, so they don’t always follow the same naming conventions. If writing about them or topics covered in their listservs, you can get the full, proper name (and any alternates) from their individual Community pages on DigitalGov. 

Name examples include: MobileGov, SocialGov, OpenGov, Open Data, PLAIN, Government Contact Center Council (G3C), Web Content Managers Forum, and Federal Community of Practice on Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science (CCS).
