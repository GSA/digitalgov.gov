Welcome to DigitalGov.

Our mission is to transform how government learns, builds, delivers, and measures digital services in the 21st century.

And we do that by providing people in government the tools, methods, practices and policy guidance they need to deliver effective and accessible digital services.

It is our job to be the experts in the problems people in government face, and support them wherever they may be blocked.

We’ve found that agencies need:

- Guidance on implementing digital policies and initiatives
- Open access to modern methods, practices, policies, and tools
- Focused trainings and events that help teams learn and adopt new concepts
- Easy access to collaborate with others across government who are working on the same problems

## What we are working on

Over the last decade, DigitalGov has become a destination in government to learn about the methods, practices, policies and tools that are needed to create effective digital services.

And we believe DigitalGov should set the example for how government learns, builds, delivers and measures digital services in the 21st century.

We are building DigitalGov into a destination that practices the methods that it teaches, and along the way, we are going to tell the story of how we get there, using the very tools that are available in the open, across the government.
