bio: "I serve as a contracting officer for a variety of construction-related procurements for the Public Buildings Service. I have a career background in Finance, Education, and Computer Science. I have BA in computer science from Roosevelt University, an MA in English from the University of Notre Dame, and an MBA from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

What is the use of designing a beautiful room that no one enters or takes full advantage of?"
