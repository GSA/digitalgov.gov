bio: "Gerry has published six books about the need for customer-centricity in the online world. His latest book, Transform, explains why digital transformation is far more about culture change than technology change. Gerry has spoken and consulted on digital customer experience in 35 countries. Over the years, he has worked extensively with the US government (EPA, State Department, HSS, HUD, etc.). He has also worked for the Irish, UK, Dutch, Norwegian and Canadian governments, and the European Union. The Irish Times described Gerry as one of five visionaries who have had a major impact on the development of the Web. "
