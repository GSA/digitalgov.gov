bio: "When Andy was eight, he wanted to be a poet and a paleontologist. Thirty years later, he is neither, but he uses those skills in his day job as the content design manager at an American multinational computer software company — managing a team who write under huge constraints, and uncovers artifacts from big, old software interfaces. When he’s not working, he’s creating podcasts and zines about one of his favorite topics: wooden pencils."
