bio: "Jo’s career began at the American Museum of Natural History, where she wrote and taught lessons about anthropology, paleontology, and astronomy for students and teachers in K-12 classrooms. Since then, she’s continued her practice of listening, goal-setting, and planning ways to build stronger connections between people with something to say and the audiences who matter to them. Along the way she’s worked with museums, parks, nonprofits and governments, including the NYC Department of Parks & Recreation and TreeFolks."
