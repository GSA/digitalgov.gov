bio: "The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), is a government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. FedRAMP was established in 2011 to provide a cost-effective, risk-based approach for the adoption and use of cloud services by the Federal Government. FedRAMP empowers Agencies to use modern cloud technologies, with emphasis on security and protection of federal information. The governing bodies of FedRAMP include Joint Authorization Board (JAB), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), CIO Council, and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST)."
