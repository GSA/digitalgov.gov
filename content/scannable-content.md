### Steps to take
- Use short sentences, whenever possible. Varying sentence length can add interest to a piece, but whenever possible, avoid unnecessarily long sentences — these can present obstacles to people who have difficulty reading. They can also be harder to skim on mobile devices.
- Likewise, keep your paragraphs short and focused. Short paragraphs, like short sentences, are easier to scan on mobile devices.
- Use precise and descriptive [headings](https://content-guide.18f.gov/headings-and-titles/) to help readers grasp the main points of a piece without reading it in its entirety.
- Check the continuity between sections. Paragraphs that don’t have clear thematic links from one to the next can cause difficulties for some readers.
