## Can you quickly understand the main points of the content?

**Why it’s important**: Karin is not a native English speaker and she sometimes has trouble decoding legal or bureaucratic language; John has a developmental disability and has difficulty interpreting content written above a sixth-grade reading level; Kai has low tech literacy and often doesn’t understand highly technical language.

### Steps to take
- Refer to the [plain language section](https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/plain-language/) of 18F’s Content Guide for general guidance, lists of words to avoid, and links to plain-language resources.
- As you’re writing, consider the tech literacy level of your target audience. Define technical terms that may be unfamiliar, and use a product or service’s full name before using its acronym or abbreviation. You may also consider [adding a glossary](https://github.com/18F/glossary) if your content contains many potentially unfamiliar terms.
Include in-line definitions for scientific, legal, or technical terms that you must use.
- Avoid using idiomatic language.
- Test the readability of your content using [Readable.io](https://readable.io/) or a similar tool.
