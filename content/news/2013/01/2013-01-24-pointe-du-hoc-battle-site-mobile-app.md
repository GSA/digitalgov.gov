The [American Battle Monuments Commission](http://www.abmc.gov/home.php) (ABMC) developed both [Android and iPhone versions](http://www.abmc.gov/events/PDH_APP_Release.php), which take advantage of your smartphone&#8217;s GPS features to provide a walking tour of the battle site in Normandy and allows you to experience how U.S. Army Rangers scaled the 100 ft. cliffs of Pointe du Hoc, destroyed a critical German battery and took control of the coastal highway, playing a crucial role in the Allied success of D-Day.

While the app is intended for visitors to the battle site, once downloaded, users can take a virtual tour, which includes both audio and video elements.

ABMC plans to launch a French language version sometime this year as well as a web-based app that will be hosted at [www.abmc.gov](http://www.abmc.gov).
