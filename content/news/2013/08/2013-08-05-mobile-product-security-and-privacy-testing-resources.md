Security testing is used to ensure that a mobile product does not pose a threat to agency IT systems and databases. In addition, privacy testing ensures that an app does not put the user’s personally identifiable information into a compromisable position.

This article was developed as part of the [Mobile Application Development Program](https://digital.gov/resources/mobile-application-development-program/ "Mobile Application Development Program"). See our [general guidelines to testing](https://digital.gov/2013/08/22/mobile-product-testing-guidelines/ "Mobile Product Testing Guidelines and Resources") article for more resources on mobile product testing.

GPS, IMEI, device numbers, and customer personal information all have privacy implications that must be noted. At a minimum, the security assessment should be accomplished through a data sensitivity impact level process and/or privacy impact assessment requirement. Agencies should:

  * Handle Web history/caching
  * Securely transmit login data
  * Avoid “man-in-the-middle” attacks
  * Securely transmit sensitive data
  * Protect from session hijacking
  * Permanently deletes data
  * Securely handle interruptions
  * Properly secure data in backups_Privacy_

Other issues to consider:

  * Is private data kept private?
  * Stored personal data is password protected and/or encrypted.
  * Transmission of personal data from device to device is encrypted.
  * Limit user privileges (i.e. limiting access to certain files).
