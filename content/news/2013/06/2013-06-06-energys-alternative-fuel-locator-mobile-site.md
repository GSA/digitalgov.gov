Drivers can find the closest alternative fueling sites anytime, anywhere with the [Alternative Fuel Locator](http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/locator/m/stations/).

The Department of Energy’s [Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)](http://www.eere.energy.gov/) has created this mobile website that allows users to locate alternative fueling stations. Using Google map technology and data from the [Alternative Fuels Data Center](http://www.afdc.energy.gov/) (AFDC), the site allows drivers to map the closest biodiesel (B20 and above), electric, ethanol (E85), hydrogen, liquefied natural gas (LNG), compressed natural gas, or propane fueling sites.

Upon opening the page, a drop down list allows the driver to choose a fuel source, then enter their location (Address, zip-code, or city.) Results are displayed on a map showing the closest matching fueling stations, driving directions, and each station’s contact information and business hours.

This mobile site provides users with easily accessible information that will allow us to keep up with the growing demand for both mobile technology and renewable energy technology.
