Challenge and prize competitions are one tool that federal agencies use to drive innovation and solve mission-centric problems—whether technical, scientific, or creative. One type of competition is ideation, which allows you to collect ideas from a wide and diverse population to solve a particular business problem. Ideas could include suggestions, approaches, plans, proposals, designs, or other proposed solutions in written, graphic, or video form.

This section provides tips on running an ideation challenge, resources, examples, and information about online platforms you can use to host your competition.

## Definition

<div>
  <p>
    Ideation is the process of generating and developing new ideas to solve a problem or improve a product, process, or service. Public and private sector organizations commonly engage in ideation with the public or their customers. Challenge and prize competitions can gather ideas from the public, including experts, academics, students, and the private sector, on how to solve a problem. Sometimes the ideation phase is the first of several stages, where ideas are implemented in later phases, such as an apps or <a href="https://digital.gov/wp-admin/post.php?post=94962&action=edit">technology demonstration challenge</a>.

    <a name="tips-for-conducting-an-ideation-challenge"></a>Tips for Conducting an Ideation Challenge
  </h2>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Clearly define the problem</strong>: This is the most critical part of setting up any challenge. If you don’t clearly define the problem, it will be hard for people to engage and submit relevant ideas. For ideation, be sure to use plain language to ask the question you want people to answer.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Have clear evaluation criteria</strong>: This helps direct the participants and those who will evaluate and judge submissions throughout the process. The specific evaluation criteria should be outlined at the beginning of the competition to direct the focus of participant solutions. You should develop a clear plan for judging and evaluation during the competition planning.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Define policies, rules, and requirements</strong>: Identify the policies that your ideation challenge must comply with, such as privacy, Terms of Use, and the type of submissions allowed. Define the rules and requirements that entrants must comply with.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Identify success metrics up front</strong>: Don’t wait until your challenge is underway to figure out how you’ll measure the success of the challenge program. Develop a clear plan for this during the planning phase of your challenge. Evaluation metrics will depend on your challenge&#8217;s goal, but common metrics include: the number of submissions, the utility and relevance of solutions, level of community engagement, and the impact of solutions&#8217; implementation on the public.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Determine platform type and capabilities</strong>: Think about the type of ideation platform you want based on the solutions you are seeking. You may want to have a more fluid ideation community in which ideas are submitted and other users can submit feedback to hone in on solutions. Or perhaps you want a platform to showcase ideas and have users rate their effectiveness. Any number of options exist for the submissions, judging, moderating, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Plan competition communication strategy</strong>: Be prepared to invest staff time in reading and responding to competition entrants, especially in the few days leading up to the competition deadline. Updating the community frequently helps to engage the participants as part of the process. The more engagement you have with people, the better opportunity for solid and increasingly innovative results. In addition, this engagement can have long-lasting impact when you want to engage people for other initiatives.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Plan the judging process</strong>: It can vary depending on the overall goals of the challenge. For stronger community engagement, you might consider more peer-centered judging. To lend greater authority to the decision, you might want to have expert judges or internal representatives lead the judging process.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Include implementation plans</strong>: In order for people to participate in current and future efforts, you must invest time to provide feedback and actually <strong>implement</strong> winning ideas. After the challenge ends, let people know what you plan to do with the winning ideas.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Determine what prize will motivate solvers</strong>: Research shows that prizes or money are not always the primary motivator. While financial incentives can be important, people want to feel like they helped, made a difference, or improved something.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Allow citizens to form teams</strong>: Some solvers would rather do work in groups than tackle a problem alone. And if the idea wins, you could have a passionate group ready to implement.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>How to manage public input</strong>: Develop a thick skin. Some people may use ideation challenges as an opportunity to vent, veer off topic, or give negative feedback to your agency. Don’t take it personally. Have a moderation policy in place, a plan for responding (as needed) and focus on all the good ideas you are getting.
    </li>
  </ul>
