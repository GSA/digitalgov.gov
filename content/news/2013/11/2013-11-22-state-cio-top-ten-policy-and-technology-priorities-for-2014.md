This year, NASCIO’s annual top 10 ranking shows IT security strategies and tools are at the forefront of discussion around the states, with ‘Security’ topping the list of Priority Strategies, Management Processes and Solutions and ‘Security Enhancement Tools,’ such as continuous diagnostic monitoring, coming in second among Priority Technologies, Applications, and Tools. Following closely behind were efforts at consolidation and a continued transition to cloud services.

Project and Portfolio Management enters the top 10 for the first time in the history of NASCIO’s rankings and assumes position 4. Security, always a member of the top 10, moves to position 1.
