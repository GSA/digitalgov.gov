Awesome! But if you want an effective open source program, you have to tightly integrate open source into how your agency procures, builds, and distributes technology.

You&#8217;re not alone! There&#8217;s a [growing community](http://government.github.com/community) of [government technologists](https://github.com/government?tab=members) on [GitHub](https://github.com/) working on these issues &#8211; a place where you can quickly get the best advice. We&#8217;re contributing to this forum because we saw governments at all levels dealing with the same kinds of questions:

  * How do I choose an open source license?
  * What procurement boilerplate should I use for open source software?
  * Should I have a contribution agreement? What should it say?
  * Doesn&#8217;t the Antideficiency Act prevent public contributions to my open source project? (Spoiler: it doesn&#8217;t!)
  * Can I build my technology project in the open from the beginning?

These are just fraction of the answers you&#8217;ll need to build a successful open source program. Historically, there haven&#8217;t been a lot of best practices on how to do this work within the constraints of government &#8211; until now!

If you haven&#8217;t used GitHub before, it&#8217;s a platform for sharing code and collaborating on content. Agencies are increasingly releasing repositories of open source code on <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. We&#8217;re seeing [tremendous successes](https://github.com/project-open-data/project-open-data.github.io), and also some [major failures.](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/10/obamacare-github/) But most importantly, we&#8217;re all learning as we go, in a forum where we can get immediate feedback from the public and technology experts in the private sector. We&#8217;re not just providing a semi-private community for federal employees, we&#8217;re also showcasing the latest open government work from around the world.

Signing up is simple &#8211; just make sure you have a [verified government email](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-email-verification) on your [GitHub account](https://github.com/). You can have multiple email addresses per account.

You should be automatically added to the organization and can head to <https://github.com/government> at any time to get started. If you&#8217;re having issues joining the community, email government@github.com.

We know it&#8217;s hard to stay on top of emerging open source standards. Especially when the best practices themselves are improving and changing so quickly! We&#8217;re here to help. GitHub for Government was setup by **Ben Balter**, a first-round Presidential Innovation Fellow. He&#8217;s written code for the CFPB, FCC, and the White House &#8211; he understands the promise and challenge of setting up an open source program.

If you have overall questions, reach out! I&#8217;m [@noahkunin on Twitter](https://twitter.com/noahkunin) and I&#8217;ll make time for anyone who&#8217;s engaged with this work. You can also check out the CFPB&#8217;s new <a title="CFPB GitHub Portal" href="http://cfpb.github.io/" target="_blank">open source portal on GitHub</a>. Hope to see you in the community soon!
