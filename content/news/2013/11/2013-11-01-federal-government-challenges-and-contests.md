    <h2>
      Why It&#8217;s Important
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      Challenges, prizes, and other incentive-based strategies can be used by federal agencies to find innovative or cost-effective solutions.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Challenges allow the public and the government to co-create. They allow government to tap into the collective knowledge and resources of the public, and help the public more easily contribute their expertise to find better solutions.
