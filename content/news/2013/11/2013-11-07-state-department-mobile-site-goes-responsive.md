The site auto-detects mobile devices and displays the State mobile site by default.

State&#8217;s mobile site provides the latest foreign policy information from the State Department. Included are recent stories from the Secretaryâ€™s travels, the daily press briefing, country fact sheets, human rights reports, and more.

[Responsive design]({{< ref "/topics/responsive-web-design" >}}) is becoming a popular means of creating a single site that can display nicely on a range of device sizes.
