Are you active or retired Coast Guard — or related to someone who is? If so, you’ll want to spread the word about the United States Coast Guard&#8217;s Health, Safety and Work Life (HSWL) app from [USCG’s Office of Work-Life Programs](http://www.uscg.mil/HSWL/).

The app, available for [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/uscg-hswl/id669218420?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ravensolutions.coastguard&hl=en) phones, is a one-stop information portal for many of the support services Coasties and their dependents might need. Among its broad offerings, the app helps users:

• Access health and medical services information and online resources;
  
• Connect to housing, childcare and legal assistance;
  
• Find a chaplain nearby;
  
• Learn all about morale, well-being and recreation (MWR) services, including a rundown of fitness programs;
  
• Contact an ombudsman; and
  
• Access the latest Coast Guard blogs and popular Facebook page.

Not in the Coast Guard but wish you were? This app puts an impressive list of the Coast Guard&#8217;s action-packed YouTube videos in the palm of your hand:

• Looking for that footage of the U.S. Airways jet that landed in the Hudson River? It’s in there.
  
• Want to see what 40,000 pounds of seized cocaine look like? Well, that’s in there too.
  
• Or simply watch the agency’s “Top 10 Rescue Videos” to get your adrenaline pumping. (And be sure to use WIFI when you do for better video streaming.)
