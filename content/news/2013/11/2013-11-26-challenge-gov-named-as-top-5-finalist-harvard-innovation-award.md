Here are details from Harvard about this prestigious award and the types of innovations that are being recognized at the federal, state, and local levels:

> **The Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at Harvard Kennedy School today announced the finalists for the Innovations in American Government Award. These five programs represent innovations at the city, county, state, and federal levels of government and were selected from a pool of more than 600 applicants following rigorous rounds of evaluation. The Innovations Award winner will be announced later this year.**
> 
> Funded by the Ford Foundation, the Innovations in American Government Award Program identifies and promotes excellence in the public sector. Winners are chosen based on novelty, effectiveness, significance, and the degree to which their innovations can inspire replication in other government entities. Past winners offer unique solutions to a range of issues including economic opportunity, public health, education, juvenile justice, and environmental management. Many programs act as harbingers for reform, and often inform research and academic study around key policy areas both at Harvard Kennedy School and academic institutions worldwide.
> 
> “These finalists demonstrate the many ways innovative leaders build engaged, healthy, and safe communities through public-sector innovation” said Stephen Goldsmith, Daniel Paul Professor of the Practice of Government, director of the Innovations in American Government Program, and previous Innovations Award winner. “We are pleased to recognize these innovative initiatives, and encourage other government entities to replicate their effective solutions to public problems.”

> Challenge.gov is the federal government’s online portal for running challenge and prize competitions. Challenges allow the government to crowdsource solutions to problems in a contest format, bringing diversity in solutions and contributors. This is a pay-for performance model that saves money on key initiatives and broadly drives innovation within and beyond government.

Since its inception, nearly 500 government innovations across all jurisdiction levels have been recognized and have collectively received more than $20 million in grants to support dissemination efforts.
