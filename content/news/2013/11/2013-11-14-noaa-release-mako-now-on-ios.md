{{< legacy-img src="2013/11/NOAA-release-mako.jpeg" alt="Home screen of NOAA's Release Mako app showing two sharks and asking fishermen to submit shark release data by pinpointing on a map. " >}}The [NOAA Release Mako App](http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/hms/shortfinmako/mako_app.html) was created for fisherman to report their releases of Shortfin Mako sharks while on the water. In order to offer the tool on another platform, the [National Marine Fisheries Service](http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/) released an iOS version of the app earlier this year.

Like the [Android version]({{< ref "2012-04-26-noaas-release-mako-app.md" >}} "NOAA’s Release Mako App"), it uses GPS and allows fisherman to upload photographs of their catches. NOAA says:

> The app uses a device&#8217;s built-in GPS, when available, to fill in exact location coordinates on the shortfin mako live release data form. The catch and release reports submitted via email allow fishermen to put their mako on the [Live Shortfin Mako Releases Interactive Web Map](http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/hms/shortfinmako/Map/index.htm)
> 
> The submission form is easy to fill out and operates like the online submission form. Touching the latitude and longitude boxes provides an location when GPS is available. The app also includes information about shortfin mako stock status, fishing regulations, FAQs, and safe handling and release guidelines.

Check out how NOAA [conceptualized this app]({{< ref "2012-04-26-noaas-release-mako-app.md" >}} "NOAA’s Release Mako App"). You can find more government mobile products like the [Release Mako](http://apps.usa.gov/release-mako.shtml) App on the [USA.gov Apps Gallery](http://apps.usa.gov/).
