Challenge and prize competitions are one path that federal agencies take to drive innovation and solve mission-centric problems—whether technical, scientific, or creative. One type of competition is software and apps challenges, where solvers are asked to develop specific software or other code-based technical solutions, such as websites, mobile applications, or algorithms.

Here you’ll find tips on running a software/apps challenge, resources, examples and information about online platforms you can use to host your competition.

## Definition

A software/apps challenge is when an organization asks the public to create software that may use a particular data set or have a set of functionalities outlined by the seeker, in order to solve an existing problem or draw attention to open and available datasets.

  Tips for Running a Software/Apps Challenge
</h2>

  * Decide what kind of solution you are seeking. The platform that serves you best can vary depending on whether you are only seeking proposals, prototypes, or fully developed applications or code.
  * Depending on complexity, a series of small challenges may be preferable to a large one that demands more time and resources.
  * Consider two-phase challenges, focused first on ideas or proposals and then on actual prototypes or functioning applications or solutions.
  * Know whether you want to catalyze the creation of open source code and software that others can build upon, or if it is necessary for your agency to own the intellectual property rights (or license them).
  * Determine what prizes will motivate your solvers: Do you have access to key people in the industry who can be judges? Could you offer time with a venture capital or business consulting firm? Is the prize money enough to get people to invest their time? Are you asking competitors to stretch themselves and be innovative?
  * Consider the role of the public when choosing a platform. You may want the public to have input in the decision through voting, or give feedback on submissions to promote further development.
  * Communicate with the participants. In the rules, it is best to clearly outline what it is you are seeking, available datasets, how you intend to use the software or solutions developed, etc. so competitors can develop better solutions and they will know how their contributions will be used.
  * Determine from the beginning and state in the challenge rules details about technology ownership, parameters for submissions, who qualifies to enter, how the entries will be judged and how the prizes will be awarded.
  * Please see the multiple resources listed below. There are so many ways to run apps challenges, that experts have created pages of plans and details that will further your understanding and goals. Choose what is best for your agency needs and goals.

  Examples
</h2>

[Apps for Vehicles
  ](http://appsforvehicles.challengepost.com/) The &#8220;Apps for Vehicles&#8221; challenge, part of the Department of Energy&#8217;s &#8220;Energy Data Initiative,&#8221; was designed to improve safety and fuel efficiency through data innovation. Entrants were asked to use vehicle open data, such as engine speed, brake position, and distance covered to create novel ways to improve safety and efficiency. One of the winning entries, MyCarma, uses the gas mileage data of each individual user to create a personal fuel economy sticker, and can offer other makes/models that may save money in the future based on the user&#8217;s driving style. The DOE awarded $16,000 in prizes to multiple winners for the first phase of the competition.

[DTRA Algorithm Challenge
  ](https://www.innocentive.com/ar/challenge/9933138) The Defense Threat Reduction Agency issued this challenge to develop an algorithm with the goal of specific identification of organisms from a stream of DNA sequences. An incredible 2,700+ entries were submitted in hopes of winning a portion of the $1 million in prize money.

[CMS Provider Screening Challenge](http://www.topcoder.com/cms/medicaid-enrollment-portal/)
  
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued this challenge to develop a system to screen Medicaid providers in order to validate credentials, authenticate identity, and check for sanctions, among others. The solution needed to be able to function in a multi-state and multi-program capacity. CMS offered between $500,000 and $600,000 to the winning entrants. The unique aspect of this competition was dividing it into more than 100 small, discrete challenges.

[Apps for Energy](http://appsforenergy.challengepost.com/)
  
&#8220;Apps for Energy&#8221; is a mobile application challenge sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy seeking apps that help consumers make the most of Green Button electricity use data. Green Button is a public data source for energy use, so the challenge was initiated with the hopes of developing applications that would help consumers better manage their energy usage. The winning application, Leafully, was developed not only to inform consumers about their personal energy usage but also to put that information into meaningful terms to educate users about their energy footprint. The U.S. Department of Energy awarded $100,000 in prizes to eight winners, ranging from $6,000 to $30,000.

[MyMoneyAppUp](http://ideabank.mymoneyappup.challengepost.com/)
  
The U.S. Department of the Treasury sponsored the MyMoneyAppUp challenge for the development of applications to help citizens take a more active role in controlling and shaping their financial futures. It was a two-part challenge with a total prize purse of $27,500 in which the public was asked to contribute ideas in the first phase, and create the software applications in phase two.

[Apps for Communities](http://appsforcommunities.challengepost.com/)
  
The FCC challenged the developers to use hyper-local government and public data to create applications that helps Americans have greater access to such personalized information and foster a richer connection between the public and their local or tribal governments, regardless of geography, race, or economic status. The FCC offered $100,000 in prizes ranging from $1,000 to $30,000 for the best overall application.
