Then as screen real estate increases, add in tasks/features as needed based on user priority.

This means the site will work (to some degree) on that shiny new web-enabled gizmo sitting under your neighbor’s Christmas tree 4 years from now.

  * Allows websites to reach more people (77% of the world’s population has a mobile device, 85% of phones sold in 2011 equipped with browser)
  * Forces designers to focus on core content and functionality (What do you do when you lose 80% of your screen real estate?)
  * Lets designers innovate and take advantage of new technologies (geolocation, touch events and more)

By first creating an experience that prioritizes a worst-case mobile scenario, you ensure that your users will be able to accomplish their goals despite a lot of factors working against them. In short, if you can support the mobile web, you can support anything.

According to <a href="http://www.lukew.com/resources/mobile_first.asp" rel="nofollow">Luke Wroblewski</a>, a leading proponent of mobile first design, going mobile first:

  * prepares you for the explosive growth and new opportunities emerging on mobile today,
  * forces you to focus and prioritize your products by embracing the constraints inherent in mobile design, and
  * allows you to deliver innovative experiences by building on new capabilities native to mobile devices and modes of use.

Mobile first is closely related to the concept of [responsive web design]({{< ref "2013-06-11-responsive-design.md" >}} "Responsive Design Overview, Resources and Tools") which uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#CSS3" rel="nofollow">W3C CSS3 media queries</a>.
