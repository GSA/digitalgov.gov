Following up on their <a href="https://digital.gov/2013/05/30/social-securitys-mobile-website/">mobile website</a>, the [Social Security Administration](http://www.ssa.gov/) recently released the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Mobile Wage Reporting app for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.ssa.mkwr&hl=en_US&gl=US">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ssi-mobile-wage-reporting/id563535561">iOS</a> devices.

The [SSI program](to https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/) pays benefits to [disabled adults (PDF, 894 kb, 17 pages)](http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-11000.pdf) and [children (PDF, 235 kb, 20 pages)](http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10026.pdf) who have limited income and resources. SSI benefits also are payable to people 65 and older without disabilities who meet the financial limits.

The app allows SSI recipients and their families to report their monthly wages to Social Security from their finger tips. Consistent monthly wage reporting is a key aspect in preventing improper payments which can lead to SSI over- and underpayments.

Citizens interested in using this app are encouraged to contact their [local Social Security field office](https://secure.ssa.gov/ICON/main.jsp) to see if they are eligible.
