Mobile searching has become a fact of life. According to a recent study by [Econsultancy](http://econsultancy.com/us/blog/63230-30-compelling-mobile-search-statistics), 67% of smartphone owners had used their device to search for information in the past 7 days. The infographic below describes what they are searching for&#8211;the majority of searches are for arts, events and news.

Last year Google predicted that [mobile search will overtake the desktop search over the next few years](http://econsultancy.com/us/nma-archive/61724-mobile-search-will-top-desktop-in-next-few-years-says-google-s-carrington) as tablet and smartphone growth continue to surge, doubling every 2 years.

According to [Google&#8217;s Mobile Search Moments Study](http://www.google.com/think/research-studies/creating-moments-that-matter.html), 40% of mobile searches have a local focus, with 77% of mobile searches occurring at home or at work and, 17% taking place while users are on the go. Shopping queries are twice as likely to take place while the user is in a store.

It is important to take this information into account [when optimizing websites]({{< ref "2013-08-27-trends-on-tuesday-why-you-should-be-accessible-on-mobile.md" >}} "Trends on Tuesday: Why You Should Be Accessible on Mobile") and thinking [mobile first]({{< ref "2013-09-30-mobile-first.md" >}} "Mobile First") so that constituents, vendors, employees, and stakeholders can access your information, anytime, anywhere.
