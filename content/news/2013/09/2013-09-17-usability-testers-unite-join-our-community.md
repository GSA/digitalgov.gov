Our <a href="{{< ref "/resources/digitalgov-user-experience-resources.md" >}}">DigitalGov User Experience Program</a> (formerly known as First Fridays)<a href="http://www.howto.gov/firstfridays"> </a>has taught dozens of agencies how to conduct these vital tests, and we even created a monthly group to talk about how to run these tests, and make them better.

  We call it the <a title="Web Content Managers Forum" href="{{< ref "web-managers-forum.md" >}}">User Experience Community</a>, and all federal employees who are interested in usability testing are welcome to join. We have a monthly conference call where we share resources, tips and stories from our experiences. Hope to see you at the next one.

  P.S. We’ve written before about all of the great<a href="{{< ref "/communities" >}}"> government discussion groups</a> that you can join, from Web Metrics to Accessibility to Mobile Strategy. Check ‘em out!
