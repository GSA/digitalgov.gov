Harvard&#8217;s Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation announced the <a title="harvard top 25 innovations in government" href="http://www.ash.harvard.edu/Home/News-Events/Press-Releases/Innovations/Top-25-Innovations-in-Government-Announced2/Top-25-Programs" target="_blank">Top 25 Innovations in Government</a> May 1. A winner and four finalists will be revealed this fall.

The<a title="washington post article harvard top 25 government innovations" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/wp/2013/05/01/harvards-ash-center-announces-top-25-innovations-in-government/" target="_blank"> Washington Post</a> described how Harvard&#8217;s review committee selected the finalists and why this is important. Against the tide of talk about sequestration and cuts, positive change is happening among agencies:

> &#8220;&#8230; this is a story about innovation in government at a time when people, including those on the inside, generally believe government is incapable of anything close to it.&#8221; ~ Washington Post

We&#8217;re thrilled that Challenge.gov (managed in our office) is included on this venerable list, with programs run by some of the most fantastic people we know at NARA, DOT, NASA, State, EPA, HUD, and HHS. Follow [@HarvardAsh](https://twitter.com/HarvardAsh) on Twitter for more information. Other agency posts can be found under [#Gov20](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23Gov20), which always has good conversation.
