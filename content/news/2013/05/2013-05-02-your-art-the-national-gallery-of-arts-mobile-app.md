[Your Art](http://apps.usa.gov/yourart.shtml) app, available for iOS, enriches the experience of on-site visitors and expands the Gallery’s reach by bringing its masterpieces to art lovers across the globe.

Some of this app&#8217;s features include:

  * Audio content, previously accessible only on Gallery-supplied headsets, is now available on personal devices. App users can explore the permanent collection through browsing by artist name, nationality, and theme.
  * The Collection Highlights tour invites users to explore more than 130 extraordinary works by artists including Leonardo da Vinci, Rembrandt van Rijn, Johannes Vermeer, and others.
  * A special Kid&#8217;s Tour is designed to capture the imagination of the younger generation and introduce them to the principles of art history. The audio tour is animated by actors speaking the parts of people and animals in more than 50 works of art.
  * Visitors to the Gallery will appreciate Your Art’s up-to-date listing of the latest programs and exhibitions taking place. The app also provides maps, hours, and other important information for planning a visit. Visitors may download the app prior to visiting or use the free public Wi-Fi in the West Building Information Room.

The Your Art app does require an additional 290 MB download once installed on your phone, but it is worth it, considering all of the gorgeous images of artwork that it contains.  You can view more mobile products like Your Art on the [USA.gov Apps Gallery](http://apps.usa.gov/).
