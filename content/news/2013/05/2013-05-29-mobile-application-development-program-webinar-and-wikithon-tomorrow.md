Anytime, anywhere government information and services are becoming more important as the [public increasingly consumes information and services on the go](http://howtomobile.apps.gov/2013/05/21/smartphone-trends-2013/ "Trends on Tuesday: Smartphone Trends 2013").

As [we announced last week](http://howtomobile.apps.gov/2013/05/23/make-mobile-gov-with-the-mobile-application-development-program/ "Make Mobile Gov with the Mobile Application Development Program"), agencies can now get assistance with their mobile development efforts with our new [Mobile Application Development Program](http://gsablogs.gsa.gov/dsic/get-it-done/mobile-application-development-program/).

Tomorrow, we will host a [webinar](http://www.howto.gov/training/classes/mobile-application-development-program) and a [wikithon](http://mobilegovwiki.howto.gov/Wikithon) to highlight our program that helps agencies plan, develop, test and launch anytime, anywhere, any device mobile products and services for the public.

Join us at either event to hear how the program&#8217;s tools—developed with and by 25 agencies across government-can help your agency. In addition, you can get your questions answered and invigorate your agency&#8217;s mobile efforts.

See the links below for more details on these two exciting events.
