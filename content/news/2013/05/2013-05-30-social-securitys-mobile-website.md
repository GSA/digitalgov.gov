The [Social Security Administration](http://www.ssa.gov) recently announced their new optimized mobile website which is compatible with Android, Blackberry, iPhone, and Windows devices.

This mobile website [was developed with intelligent back end business processes](http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pressoffice/pr/ssa-mobile-pr.html) that assist users with identifying documents needed for a new/replacement Social Security number (SSN) card. Mobile users can also access many of Social Security&#8217;s publications in both English and Spanish.

Social Securityâ€™s mobile website educates the public on how to create a new account, which enables users to access online statements and other related services. The new [office locator feature](https://secure.ssa.gov/ICON/main.jsp) provides directions to a Social Security office nearest to you.
