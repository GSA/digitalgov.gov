Challenge and prize competitions are one path that federal agencies take to drive innovation and solve mission-centric problems—whether technical, scientific, or creative. Creative competitions include multimedia, photo, poster, and design competitions. 

Here you’ll find tips on running a creative challenge, resources, examples, and information about online platforms you can use to host your competition.

## Definition

Creative competitions and challenges are about (1) seeking professional, high-quality products, (2) aimed at driving mass citizen awareness and engagement around the message in the challenge, or (3) both. Agencies use this approach to get solvers to create videos, take photographs, make posters, or submit a design concept. A creative video challenge should not be confused with another type of challenge that allows solvers to submit a video of their technical or scientific concepts (please see [Software and Apps Challenges](/2013/11/06/software-and-apps-challenges/ "Software and Apps Challenges")).

## Tips for Challenge Managers

*   **Clearly define the problem**: For creative challenges, use plain language to tell the entrants what you are looking for and any parameters you expect them to follow.
*   **Go pro or amateur**: Decide whether you are in need of a professional-quality solution or if the goal is to have amateur content with a mission to share a message with a large audience. That will help you decide which platform will work best for your goals.
*   **Define your mission statement**: A clear mission statement helps direct the participants and the evaluating entity throughout the process. The same applies to the evaluation criteria; these should be outlined at the beginning to focus submissions toward a usable solution.
*   **Outline legal and policy guidelines**: Policies should be clearly defined—those to which the creative challenge must comply, as well as those that govern the kinds of submissions allowed, copyright, intellectual property rights, and Terms of Use.
*   **Track program metrics**: Have a clear plan of how you will evaluate the challenge. Depending on the mission, the number of submissions, attention on social media, popularity of submissions, etc., are useful measures of challenge success.
*   **Plan communication strategy**: Consider how you will communicate with your community and how often. Be prepared to invest staff time in reading and responding to competition entrants, especially in the few days leading up to the competition deadline. Updating the community frequently helps to engage the participants as part of the process. The more engagement you have with people, the better opportunity for solid and increasingly innovative results.
*   **Define the evaluation process**: It can vary depending on the overall goals of the challenge. For stronger community engagement, you might consider more peer-centered judging. To lend greater authority to the decision, you might want to have expert judges or internal representatives lead the evaluation process.
*   **Plan for implementation**: In order for people to participate in current and future efforts, you must invest time to provide feedback and actually **implement** winning ideas.
*   **Know what motivates entrants**: Research shows that prizes or money are not key motivators for entrants. People want to feel like they helped, made a difference, or improved something.

## Examples

**Centers for Disease Control and Prevention** has run a number of creative challenges, including: [Healthy Swimming](http://healthyswimming.challengepost.com/) video competition, [Veto Violence Public Service Announcement](http://vetoviolence.challengepost.com/) competition, and [Heads Up](http://beheadsup.challengepost.com/) poster design competition. 

**Department of the Interior** [photo challenges](https://challenge.gov/DOI) include national and natural landmarks, as well as challenges for military families. 

**U.S. Mint** used a [design challenge](http://batterup.challengepost.com/) to create a new Baseball Hall of Fame commemorative coin. 

**NASA** received professional quality video and worldwide attention for its [two multimedia challenges](http://tongal.com/sponsor/NASA): video time capsules and to promote the zero robotics challenge.

## Criteria for Choosing a Platform

Here are some criteria for choosing a multimedia platform. Add or subtract to tailor this list to your needs. 

General

*   Does this tool have (or has it had) any federal government clients?
*   Is the tool 508 compliant?

*   How much does it cost per challenge? For an enterprise license? Is a free trial available?

Functionality

Or reach out to a live person who works with federal clients, [government@youtube.com](mailto:government@youtube.com). One tool with this platform is [YouTube Direct](https://developers.google.com/youtube/ytdirect), a gadget with an API feed that goes on your main contest page (agency site, blog, etc.) to collect and organize video submissions. This gadget helps the video creator choose what they want to submit, the video then goes to your admin file where you can screen, filter, and manage the videos that will show up on your site.

### Facebook (ToS)

This [social site](http://www.facebook.com/) now allows page administrators to manage promotions and contests without using an app. This blog post explains how it can be done and provides for a set of [platform and contest guidelines](https://fbcdn-dragon-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/851577_158705844322839_2031667568_n.pdf). This is entirely a self-serve platform where page administrators are responsible for knowing how to use the tools, reach the target audience, and manage the community.

### Pinterest (ToS)

[Pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com/) is an interactive social site where users share images on their boards and “pin” things they like for themselves and others. See [Contests on Pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com/pinchat/contests-on-pinterest/) for examples and information about hosting a challenge on the site. Buick’s [design challenge](http://blogs.forrester.com/reineke_reitsma/13-04-12-the_data_digest_the_unique_profile_of_pinterest_users) on this platform impacted interior and exterior design for one of the company’s cars.
