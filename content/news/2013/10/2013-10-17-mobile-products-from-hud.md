The [Department of Housing and Urban Development](http://www.hud.gov) has two apps that can help citizens learn about their housing rights, locate housing counselors and file housing discrimination complaints.

The [HUD Counselor Locator App](http://apps.usa.gov/hud-counselor-locator-app.shtml) allows smartphone and tablet users to locate housing counselors in their own area who can help

  * distressed homeowners avoid foreclosure and obtain more favorable modifications.
  * home buyers determine if they are ready for homeownership, and connect them with safer and more affordable mortgages.
  * displaced families find alternate housing in the wake of natural disaster

The [Housing Discrimination Complaint Application](http://apps.usa.gov/housing-discrimination-complaint-application.shtml) app provides the public with a quick and easy way to learn about their housing rights and to file housing discrimination complaints.

In addition the app

  * provides information about the fair housing complaint process
  * allows the public to access HUD’s toll-free discrimination hotline and link to HUD’s fair housing website: [www.hud.gov/fairhousing](http://www.hud.gov/fairhousing)
  * can be used by individuals researching their housing rights after a natural disaster, when power outages make the iPhone/iPad one of the few ways to access the Internet.
  * informs the housing industry about its responsibilities under the [Fair Housing Act](http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/FHLaws/yourrights).

You can find more government apps like the ones from HUD on the [USA.Gov Apps Gallery](http://apps.usa.gov).
