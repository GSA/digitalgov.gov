But how do we get there? We all know that technology is only part of the answer. [Open content models](https://digital.gov/2013/07/29/how-to-create-open-structured-content/ "How to Create Open, Structured Content") and structured data are a big part of the answer.

Lakshmi Grama, Senior Digital Strategist in the Office of Communications and Education at the [National Cancer Institute (NCI)](http://www.cancer.gov/) discusses what structured content and open content models can do to help government agencies create content that is platform-agnostic, format-free, and device-independent in this November, 2013 webinar. She illustrated the case for these new practices with best practices from the public and private sectors. She also announced a federal-wide effort to identify common content models for agencies to use.
