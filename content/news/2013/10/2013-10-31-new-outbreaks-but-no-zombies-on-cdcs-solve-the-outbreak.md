The [Centers for Disease Control](http://www.cdc.gov) recently added three new outbreaks to their [Solve the Outbreak](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/solve-the-outbreak/id592485067?mt=8) app. CDC released [the app earlier this year]({{< ref "2013-02-21-cdcs-solve-the-outbreak-app.md" >}} "CDC’s Solve the Outbreak App") to teach users how CDC’s disease detectives save lives everyday. There are now nine outbreaks that players can solve to earn points.

Since it&#8217;s Halloween, I&#8217;ll note that a zombie epidemic is not one of the outbreaks. Most Digital Gov experts might expect some zombies since CDC has a habit of using the living dead as an aid for [teaching us about public health awareness.](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/19/5/ad-1905_article.htm) This is the agency that brought us the [Zombie Nation campaign](http://blogs.cdc.gov/publichealthmatters/category/zombies/zombie-nation/), pulled [zombie survival lessons from The Walking Dead](http://blogs.cdc.gov/publichealthmatters/2012/02/thewalkingdead/) and even published the graphic novel &#8220;[Zombie Outbreak](http://www.cdc.gov/phpr/zombies_novella.htm).&#8221;

The app itself is no zombie. Solve the Outbreak recently earned 4.5 out of 5 points from a NextGov industry panel, which is the highest score of any app in NextGov&#8217;s [Grading Government Apps](http://www.nextgov.com/media/webgraphics-apps/apps.html) series. The only con from the experts is the app&#8217;s lack of an Android version.

Developers of CDC&#8217;s Solve the Outbreak were featured speakers on our [You&#8217;ll Have Them at Swipe: Make an Awesome Mobile User Experience]({{< ref "2013-02-11-youll-have-them-at-swipe-making-an-awesome-mobile-user-experience-webinar.md" >}} "You’ll Have Them at Swipe: Making An Awesome Mobile User Experience Webinar") webinar and the team provided input on our recent [Mobile User Experience Guidelines and Recommendations]({{< ref "mobile-user-experience-guidelines-and-recommendations.md" >}} "Mobile User Experience Guidelines and Recommendations")._You can find other apps like [CDC&#8217;s Solve the Outbreak](http://apps.usa.gov/solvetheoutbreak-app.shtml) on the [USA.gov Apps Gallery](http://apps.usa.gov/). Happy Halloween!_
