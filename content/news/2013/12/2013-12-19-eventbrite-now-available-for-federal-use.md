Does your agency host events, organize meet-ups, or provide training and professional development?  Then <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">Eventbrite</a> can help you manage the process more easily and efficiently. Eventbrite is the latest tool with a <a href="{{< ref "negotiated-terms-of-service-agreements.md" >}}">federal-compatible Terms of Service</a>.

Eventbrite is an online ticketing service that allows event organizers to plan, set up registration or <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/l/sell-tickets/">ticket sales</a> and promote events and publish them across Facebook, Twitter and other social-networking tools directly from the site’s interface.

Eventbrite can be a useful tool for promoting events, tracking how many people have registered,  and communicating with those who have registered. The web-based interface can be used for both small events with fewer than 50 participants or large events with thousands of attendees.

So if you want to give Eventbrite a try please collaborate with  <a href="{{< ref "agency-points-of-contact-for-federal-compatible-terms-of-service-agreements.md" >}}">your agency’s Point-of-Contact for Terms of Service</a>  and share the Eventbrite terms of service with your agency’s lawyers, and explore whether this new tool can help meet your strategic goals.
