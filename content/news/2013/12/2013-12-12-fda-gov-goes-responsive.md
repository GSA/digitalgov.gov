Thanks to the digital team at the **[U.S. Food & Drug Administration](http://www.fda.gov/)**, you now have access to the latest drug and food product recalls the agency oversees right at your fingertips thanks to their new [mobile-friendly FDA.gov homepage](http://blogs.fda.gov/fdavoice/index.php/2013/11/fda-takes-a-responsive-approach-to-mobile-web/).

Doctors, pharmacists, nurses and patients on-the-go can also “**Report an adverse event**” directly from the mobile homepage screen, too — and important action made much more convenient.

Looking for **specific medication or food product**? It&#8217;s easy to use the Search function, which is front and center on the page. **Consumer updates**, **news** and **FDA blogs** round out other direct-from-homepage offerings.
