[{{< legacy-img src="2014/01/Gov-Apps.png" alt="Gov Apps" >}}](https://s3.amazonaws.com/digitalgov/_legacy-img/2014/01/Gov-Apps.png)Today we want to tell you about the federal agency trends we saw this year in the development of public facing mobile products.

**Digital Government Strategy drove Mobile Gov Development** [Digital Government Strategy](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html#milestone-6-2) milestone 7.2 required agencies to implement two public facing mobile products in May. The White House [highlighted these agency mobile product implementations](http://www.whitehouse.gov/digitalgov/mobile).

**Responsive Design Proliferated.** During the summer and fall a number of agencies like the [Department of State](http://apps.usa.gov/state-department-mobile.shtml "State Department Mobile Site Goes Responsive"), [Department of Commerce]({{< ref "2013-10-30-redesigning-commerce-gov.md" >}} "Redesigning Commerce.gov"), [Department of Energy]({{< ref "2014-01-09-energy-gov-goes-responsive.md" >}} "Energy.gov goes Responsive"), [USA.gov]({{< ref "2013-08-20-embracing-responsive-design.md" >}} "Embracing Responsive Design"), [Food and Drug Administration]({{< ref "2013-12-12-fda-gov-goes-responsive.md" >}} "FDA.gov Goes Responsive"), and [HUD&#8217;s Office of the Inspector General]({{< ref "2013-10-17-mobile-products-from-hud.md" >}} "Mobile Products from HUD") implemented responsively designed websites.

**Native Apps Still Important**. Agencies did not abandon native development. A number of agencies took advantage of native mobile device functionality including [U.S. Census&#8217; Dwellr]({{< ref "2013-12-05-u-s-census-bureau-dwellr-app.md" >}} "U.S. Census Bureau Dwellr App"), [NOAA&#8217;s Whale Alert]({{< ref "2013-07-25-noaas-whale-alert-ship-strike-reduction-for-right-whales-app.md" >}} "NOAA’s Whale Alert – Ship Strike Reduction for Right Whales App"), [Dolphin & Whale 911, and See & ID Dolphins & Whales]({{< ref "2013-10-24-dolphin-and-whale-apps-from-noaa-fisheries.md" >}} "Dolphin and Whale Apps from NOAA Fisheries"), U.S. Coast Guard&#8217;s [HSWL App]({{< ref "2013-11-21-coast-guard-hswl-app.md" >}} "Coast Guard HSWL App"), and National Park Service&#8217;s [NPS Chesapeake Explorer App]({{< ref "2013-06-20-nps-chesapeake-explorer-app.md" >}} "NPS Chesapeake Explorer App").

**Upgrades and Makeovers for Existing Mobile Products.** FEMA added a [disaster reporter feature](http://www.fema.gov/disaster-reporter) to the [FEMA App,](http://www.fema.gov/smartphone-app) the Center&#8217;s for Disease Control added [new outbreaks to their Solve the Outbreak app]({{< ref "2013-10-31-new-outbreaks-but-no-zombies-on-cdcs-solve-the-outbreak.md" >}}) and the U.S. Census added new economic indicators to the [America&#8217;s Economy](http://apps.usa.gov/americas-economy.shtml) app. The Department of Energy&#8217;s National Renewable Energy Laboratory [created an iOS app](http://apps.usa.gov/alternative-fueling-stationp-locator.shtml) version of the [alternative fuel locator mobile website](http://apps.usa.gov/alternative-fuel-locator.shtml) and the National Gallery of Art added an [Android version of their Your Art app]({{< ref "2013-12-26-your-art-now-on-android.md" >}} "Your Art App Now on Android").

**APIs and Code Sharing Continued to Expand.** While the Digital Government Strategy required [development of API&#8217;s](http://www.data.gov/developers/page/developer-resources) as well as mobile products, some agencies took bigger steps to make it easier for developers to access government code.

<ul class="how_to_mobile_list">
  <li>
    As part of their Digital Government Strategy mobile implementation, the Department of Labor <a href="http://www.dol.gov/digital-strategy/DigitalGovernance7-2.htm">mobilized their developer website for anytime, anywhere access to their API&#8217;s</a>. Labor also developed an agency wide software development kit (SDK) that makes agency API&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/USDepartmentofLabor/Android_DOLDataSDK/wiki">more easily accessible for mobile development</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Like they did with the <a title="U.S. Census America’s Economy App" href="http://apps.usa.gov/americas-economy.shtml">America&#8217;s Economy app</a> last year, the U.S. Census Bureau released their new app <a title="U.S. Census Bureau Dwellr App" href="{{< ref "2013-12-05-u-s-census-bureau-dwellr-app.md" >}}">Dwellr</a> with <a href="http://www.census.gov/developers/">API documentation</a> that allows users to create their own app using Census data.
  </li>
  <li>
    A number of agencies ran mobile related challenges at Challenge.gov, including ones for <a href="http://mymoneyappup.challengepost.com/">mobile product ideas,</a> <a href="http://combatfeedinghack.challengepost.com/">app development</a> and even the <a href="http://www.health2con.com/devchallenge/mobilizing-data-for-pressure-ulcer-prevention-challenge/">mobilization of their data</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

**Cross Agency Sharing Multiplied.** There was an influx of cross agency sharing of mobile development practices, tools and solutions. In conjunction with the Federal CIO Council, we developed the [Mobile Application Development Program]({{< ref "mobile-application-development-program.md" >}} "Mobile Application Development Program"). To help us create the program, agencies in the [MobileGov Community of Practice]({{< ref "mobilegov.md" >}} "Mobile") shared

<ul class="how_to_mobile_list">
  <li>
    Procurement documents to create <a title="Mobile SOW and Developer Qualifications" href="{{< ref "mobile-sow-and-developer-qualifications.md" >}}">sample mobile Statements of Work (SOWs)</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a title="Mobile Product Testing Guidelines and Resources" href="{{< ref "2013-08-22-mobile-product-testing-guidelines.md" >}}">Mobile testing tools, practices, scripts, and time</a> to actually help agencies test mobile products
  </li>
  <li>
    <a title="Mobile User Experience Guidelines and Recommendations" href="{{< ref "mobile-user-experience-guidelines-and-recommendations.md" >}}">User Experience Guidelines and Recommendations</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Mobile code on the <a title="Federal Mobile Code Sharing Catalog Is Here" href="{{< ref "2013-05-13-federal-mobile-code-sharing-catalog-is-here.md" >}}">Mobile Code Catalog</a> for other agencies to leverage
  </li>
</ul>

**What to Expect in 2014.** As we gaze into our Mobile Gov crystal ball for 2014, we see

<ul class="how_to_mobile_list">
  <li>
    <strong>More Agency Sharing.</strong> Like they did for <a title="Mobile User Experience Guidelines and Recommendations" href="{{< ref "mobile-user-experience-guidelines-and-recommendations.md" >}}">Mobile User Experience Guidelines and Recommendations</a>, the Mobile Gov Community of Practice will continue to gather agencies together to build government-wide expertise in mobile. Expect events around responsive design, native development and other mobile areas soon.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Increased Focus on User Experience.</b> Agencies are placing more importance on usability and user experience as they build and update mobile products. The advanced ones will be heavily engaging with their users to accomplish it.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Emphasis on Code Sharing.</b> Agencies will continue to increase their code sharing for development and reuse. The U.S. Census Bureau approach will be a model for a lot of agencies and more agencies <a href="https://github.com/USDepartmentofLabor/Android_DOLDataSDK/wiki">will leverage the agency wide API SDK from Labor</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Focus on Data Structures and Content Models. </b>Agencies will continue to rethink their data structures and <a title="Always Future Ready: The Benefits of Open Content Models and Structured Data Webinar" href="{{< ref "2013-10-28-always-future-ready-the-benefits-of-open-content-models-and-structured-data-webinar.md" >}}">create new content models </a>for the proliferation of <a title="Mary Meeker’s Internet Trends Report" href="{{< ref "2013-06-05-mary-meekers-internet-trends-report.md" >}}">wearables, sharables, flyables and drivables</a> we will see in 2014 and beyond.
  </li>
</ul>
