Now their code is available for agencies to leverage for mobile development.

All the apps&#8217; code are available on the [Mobile Code Sharing Catalog](http://gsa.github.io/Mobile-Code-Catalog/index.html) &#8211;a resource for developers that can help them find source code for native and web projects from a variety of sources.

  * [DOL Timesheet](http://apps.usa.gov/dol-timesheet.shtml) allows users to keep track of the amount of hours worked in a week and calculates an estimated income. It even takes into account overtime after 40 hours of work in a week and implements the necessary calculations to determine the amount that may be owed.
  * [LaborStats](http://apps.usa.gov/labor-stats.shtml) captures various news releases published by the Department of Labor’s Employment and Training Administration (ETA) and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).
  * [OSHA Heat Index Tool](http://howtomobile.apps.gov/2011/08/25/oshas-heat-safety-tool/ "OSHA’s Heat Safety Tool") allows workers and supervisors to calculate the heat index for their worksite, and, based on the heat index, display a risk level to outdoor workers.

Hear more about how these apps and the Mobile Code Sharing Catalog can help your agency&#8217;s mobile efforts today by listening to the archive of our Mobile Code Sharing Webinar featuring DOL&#8217;s Mike Pulsifer below.
