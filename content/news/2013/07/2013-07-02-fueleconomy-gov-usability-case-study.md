Many technical websites have a hard time explaining information to the general public. This happens because users don’t understand the industry-specific or scientific terms. Fortunately, solutions to these problems are fairly easy—changing menu and navigation item text, or adding a line of explanatory text on key pages or complex graphics.

The DigitalGov User Experience Program helped conduct a usability test on the Department of Energy&#8217;s [fueleconomy.gov](http://fueleconomy.gov/) mobile site in February 2013 that resulted in three top usability problems and solutions. After they implementing our solutions,  the mobile [fueleconomy.gov](http://fueleconomy.gov/) site traffic dramatically increased—for some pages by more than 1000%!

## Problem 1: Terms Unclear and Jargony

Users were confused about the difference between &#8220;My MPG&#8221; and &#8220;Find a Car&#8221; on the homepage.

## Solution 1: Clarify Terms

The &#8220;My MPG&#8221; was changed to &#8220;Calculate My MPG&#8221; and &#8220;Find a Car&#8221; was changed to &#8220;Find and Compare Cars&#8221;.

## Problem 2: Hard to Find and Misleading Buttons

Users were confused by the &#8220;Add a Car&#8221; button or missed it.

## Solution 2: Clarify and Move Buttons

The &#8220;Add a Car&#8221; button was changed to &#8220;Compare Cars&#8221; and added to the top of the page so that users could find it.

## Problem 3: Lack of Help Buttons and Explanatory Text

There was no &#8220;Help&#8221; buttons or explanatory text for users when they encountered unfamiliar words or acronyms.

## Solution 3: Clarify Terms

A &#8220;Learn More&#8221; button was added to the bottom of the several pages, including the Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Annual Petroleum Use and EPA Smog Score pages.
