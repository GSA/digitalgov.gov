This year's summit will feature keynotes, panels, workshops, and more—showcasing technology built with open data, and how to create space for conversations on government innovation, effective collaboration, the power of open data, and the inclusion of all voices. Seven federal agencies and two cities led TOP sprints focused on the World Post-COVID-19. They’ll introduce the resulting new products and announce more than $300,000 in awards to the winners of the Open Data for Good Grand Challenge. Review the full agenda and register to attend."
