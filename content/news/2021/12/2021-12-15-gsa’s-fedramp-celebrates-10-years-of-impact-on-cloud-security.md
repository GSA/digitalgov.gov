title: GSA’s Fedramp Celebrates 10 Years of Impact on Cloud Security
deck: "**GSA’s FedRAMP Celebrates 10 Years of Impact on Cloud
  Security**&mdash;Today, the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program
  (FedRAMP) celebrates its 10-year anniversary. On December 8, 2011, the Office
  of Management and Budget (OMB) signed a memo establishing FedRAMP to provide a
  cost-effective, risk-based approach for the adoption and use of cloud
  services. This landmark reflects GSA and FedRAMP’s commitment to protecting
  public and federal information through supporting IT modernization and
  securing IT infrastructure. Over the past ten years, the program has seen an
  incredible increase in the adoption of FedRAMP-authorized services and will
  play a critical role in improving the nation's cybersecurity."
