title: GSA’s New Multi-Cloud & Hybrid Cloud Guide Helps Agencies Make Better Decisions About Cloud Architecture
deck: "**GSA’s New Multi-Cloud & Hybrid Cloud Guide Helps Agencies Make Better
  Decisions About Cloud Architecture**&mdash;Agencies need informed strategies
  to understand, anticipate, rationalize, and optimize major cloud architecture
  decisions. To facilitate the decision process, the GSA Data Center and Cloud
  Optimization Initiative Program Management Office (DCCOI PMO) is pleased to
  announce the release of the Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Cloud Guide, developed in
  collaboration with the Cloud and Infrastructure Community of Practice (C&I
  CoP). This guide is another example of GSA's commitment to creating simple,
  user-friendly information and resources to help federal agencies use
  technology to meet their missions in an effective and efficient way."
