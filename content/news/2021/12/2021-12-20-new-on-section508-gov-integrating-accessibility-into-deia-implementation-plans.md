title: "New on Section508.gov: Integrating Accessibility into DEIA
  Implementation Plans"
deck: **Accessibility, the “A” in DEIA, is a foundation on which the federal workforce must build diversity, equity and inclusion for people with disabilities. Without accessibility, we cannot truly achieve the others.** The GSA Government-wide IT Accessibility Program has published "[Integrating
  Accessibility into Agency Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility
  (DEIA) Implementation Plans](https://www.section508.gov/manage/deia-guidance/)," a guide designed to support the Accessibility
  roadmap outlined in the [Government-wide Strategic Plan to Advance Diversity,
  Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Strategic-Plan-to-Advance-Diversity-Equity-Inclusion-and-Accessibility-in-the-Federal-Workforce-11.23.21.pdf).  The guidance
  contained in this article is a preliminary step before offering broader
  updates to guidance and best practices materials to meet this objective. 


  We look forward to supporting your agency's Section 508 and DEIA accessibility initiatives in the new year. 


  Finally, all of us with the GSA Government-wide IT Accessibility Program would like to wish you and yours a safe and joyous holiday, and a happy new year!
summary: Accessibility, the “A” in DEIA, is a foundation on which the federal
  workforce must build diversity, equity and inclusion for people with
  disabilities. Without accessibility, we cannot truly achieve the others.
