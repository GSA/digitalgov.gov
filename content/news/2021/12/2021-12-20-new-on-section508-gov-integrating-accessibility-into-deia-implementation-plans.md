  **New on Section508.gov: Integrating Accessibility into DEIA Implementation Plans** &mdash; Accessibility, the “A” in DEIA, is a foundation on which the federal workforce must build diversity, equity and inclusion for people with disabilities. Without accessibility, we cannot truly achieve the others.

  The GSA Government-wide IT Accessibility Program has published "Integrating Accessibility into Agency Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility (DEIA) Implementation Plans," a guide designed to support the Accessibility roadmap outlined in the Government-wide Strategic Plan to Advance Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce.  The guidance contained in this article is a preliminary step before offering broader updates to guidance and best practices materials to meet this objective.
