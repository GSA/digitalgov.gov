The [Open Data for Good Grand Challenge](https://opportunity.census.gov/prize-challenge/) is welcoming submissions until October 24, 2021 from technologists and collaborators focused on deploying products with federal open data, as well as recruiting for qualified judges to score the submissions and help select winners!

The $310,000 challenge was launched this summer by the U.S. Census Bureau through [The Opportunity Project](https://opportunity.census.gov/) (TOP), in collaboration with The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

In order to advance some of the most promising technology solutions built with open data, the Census Bureau and its collaborators have launched the Open Data for Good Grand Challenge, to help teams deploy their technology solutions, ensure they reach end users, and drive impact on the critical problems they were built to solve. These solutions address problems ranging from COVID-19 to reducing oceans plastics, to helping minority-businesses access capital.

Please view the [full challenge rules on Challenge.gov](https://www.challenge.gov/?challenge=open-data-for-good-grand-challenge) for eligibility, and submission requirements and deadlines. We encourage your active involvement of entering the challenge, sharing this opportunity within your networks, or serving as a judge.
