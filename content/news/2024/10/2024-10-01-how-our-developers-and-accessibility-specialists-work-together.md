deck: "Planning for accessibility is critical to creating more inclusive digital
  experiences. Discover how developers and accessibility specialists from
  USA.gov collaborate early in the development process to ensure that their
  government websites are accessible for everyone. By following established

  (WCAG) and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, USA.gov proactively reduces
  the need for later fixes. "
