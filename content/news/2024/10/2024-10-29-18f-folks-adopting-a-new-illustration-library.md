  broad spectrum of human experiences. Moving away from simple bust portraits,
  this updated style captures more complex emotions and human interactions,
  fostering a stronger sense of connection. By focusing on inclusivity, 18F aims
  to make government content more relatable and welcoming, ensuring everyone
  feels valued and understood."
