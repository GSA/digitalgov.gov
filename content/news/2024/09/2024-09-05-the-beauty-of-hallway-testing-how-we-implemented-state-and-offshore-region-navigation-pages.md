title: "How the Open Data, Design, and Development team implemented state and offshore
  region navigation pages with hallway testing"
deck: User feedback is key to creating great digital products, but limited
  resources can hinder research efforts. Hallway testing provides a quick,
  useful solution. By conducting informal interviews, the Open Data, Design, and Development team at the Department of the Interior gathered
  insights to improve navigation to state and offshore region pages on the
  Natural Resources Revenue Data website. After testing prototypes, the best option was
  implemented, streamlining access white minimizing resource use. The team's next steps
  include monitoring performance, evaluating the addition of maps on select pages, and continued hallway testing.
