  resources can hinder research efforts. Hallway testing provides a quick,
  effective solution. By conducting informal interviews, the team gathered
  insights to improve navigation to state and offshore region pages on the
  revenue data website. After testing prototypes, the best option was
  implemented, streamlining access white minimizing resource use. Next steps
  include monitoring performance and exploring additional features like maps.
