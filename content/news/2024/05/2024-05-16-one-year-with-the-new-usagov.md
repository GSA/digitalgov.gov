title: One year with the new USAGov
deck: It has been a year since USA.gov and USAGov en Español were relaunched
  using human-centered design principles. Using task backlog, the USAGov team
  has addressed content gaps, improved discoverability, and implemented
  technical updates. Through usability tests, visitor comments, and click
  behavior the team was able to unravel and respond to user feedback and unmet
  needs, leading to noticeable increases in visitor satisfaction and task
  accomplishment. Moving forward, the focus will shift to enhancing public
  engagement with the government, improving the search for benefits-related
  content, and exploring interactive and personalized user experiences.
