title: Designing for people with disabilities
deck: The Public Experience Portfolio’s UX team conducted a study focused on
  users who rely on assistive technology to access USA.gov, partnering with a
  local organization to gather insights from a diverse group of participants,
  including those who are blind or deaf. The study revealed various habits and
  challenges faced by these users, such as a preference for mobile sites,
  difficulties with website carousels, and the importance of clear headings and
  action-oriented descriptions. These findings guide improvements in
  accessibility, such as clever link labeling and better navigation aids for
  assistive technology users.
