deck: The User Experience (UX) team at USA.gov’s  Public Experience Portfolio recently conducted a study to analyze the experiences of individuals who access USA.gov through assistive technology.., The team partnered with a local organization to gather insights from a diverse group of participants, many of whom are blind or deaf. The study revealed various habits and challenges faced by these users, such as a preference for mobile sites, difficulty with website carousels, and a reliance on clear headings and action-oriented descriptions. These findings can guide improvements in accessibility, such as clever link labeling and better navigation aids for assistive technology users.
