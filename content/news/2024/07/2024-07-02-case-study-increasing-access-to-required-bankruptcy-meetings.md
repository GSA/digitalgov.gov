title: Case study Increasing access to required bankruptcy meetings
deck: Access DOJ, a department-wide initiative led by the Office for Access in
  the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), partnered with the U.S. Trustee Program
  (USTP), to increase access to Section 341 bankruptcy meetings. During the
  COVID-19 pandemic USTP transitioned these meetings from in-person to virtual,
  reducing burdens and increasing participation. Based on feedback, USTP is
  developing mock meeting videos and revising guidance to help consumers better
  understand and prepare for virtual 341 meetings, with plans to make virtual
  meetings the standard practice nationwide by mid-2024.
