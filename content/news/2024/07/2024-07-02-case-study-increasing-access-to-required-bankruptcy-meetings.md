deck: The U.S. Trustee Program (USTP) within the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is responsible for overseeing the administration of bankruptcy cases and private trustees. Their mission is to promote the integrity and efficiency of the bankruptcy system for the benefit of all stakeholders–debtors, creditors, and the public. Learn about the USTP’s recent efforts and plans for increasing public access to Section 341 bankruptcy meetings, or initial “meetings of creditors”. These efforts include shifting to a virtual meeting structure, developing mock meeting videos, and revising guidance documents.
