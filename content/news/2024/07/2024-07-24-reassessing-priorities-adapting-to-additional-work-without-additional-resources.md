title: Reassessing priorities adapting to additional work without additional resources
deck: The Open Data, Design, and Development team (ODDD) had to take on the
  additional workload of managing an existing website without extra resources,
  prompting a reassessment of their yearly goals. They utilized a prioritization
  matrix to evaluate and prioritize tasks based on effort and reward, leading to
  a structured impact assessment and transition plan. This process not only
  ensured realistic workload adjustments but also improved team morale and
  highlighted the need for practical goal-setting, especially when
  short-staffed.
