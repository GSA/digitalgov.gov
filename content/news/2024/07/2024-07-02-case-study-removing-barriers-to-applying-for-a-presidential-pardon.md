title: "Case study: Removing barriers to applying for a presidential pardon"
deck: The Office of the Pardon Attorney (PARDON) partnered with Access DOJ, a
  department-wide initiative led by the Office for Access, both within the U.S.
  Department of Justice, to simplify and streamline the Presidential pardon
  application process, particularly for those without legal assistance. By
  conducting usability testing and gathering feedback, they identified issues
  with the existing application, such as its complexity and length. As a result,
  they redesigned the forms to be more accessible and understandable, reducing
  the overall length and complexity, and providing clear guidance and resources,
  which led to positive initial feedback and a more efficient process for both
  applicants and staff.
