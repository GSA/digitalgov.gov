title: "Ensuring Effective and Timely Usability Research"
deck: "Usability reflects how easily a user can accomplish their goals while
  using a product or service. The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs
  (OIRA) has issued new guidance to streamline usability testing for federal
  forms, websites, and services, helping agencies conduct usability tests in a
  more quick and efficient manner that is consistent with the Paperwork
  Reduction Act (PRA). By enabling faster, more effective testing, OIRA aims to
  enhance public interactions with the government and ensure equitable access to
  federal resources."
