title: Three ways to write fearless spreadsheet formulas
deck: "Spreadsheet formulas can be intimidating, especially given their critical
  role in government operations. Applying simple programming principles, 18F
  created a resource for making formulas clearer, easier to read, and less
  error-prone. 18F introduces three key techniques: using the LET function to
  name variables and organize code logically, adding comments to clarify complex
  formulas, and leveraging the LAMBDA function to break down problems into
  manageable parts. Together, these methods transform spreadsheets from sources
  of anxiety into tools of clarity and confidence."
