title: A journey of improvement creating a self assessment for ONRRs digital
  experience
deck: "The Office of Natural Resources Revenue’s Open Data, Design, and
  Development (ODD) team conducted a self-assessment of its digital products to
  ensure compliance with M-23-22, a memo issued by the Office of Management and
  Budget (OMB) guiding federal agencies toward a digital-first public
  experience. The team created a detailed spreadsheet to measure compliance
  across key areas such as accessibility, design consistency, and mobile
  responsiveness. Through collaboration efforts, they identified strengths and
  areas for improvement and developed a plan to prioritize improvements and
  engage with higher management for support on larger initiatives. "
