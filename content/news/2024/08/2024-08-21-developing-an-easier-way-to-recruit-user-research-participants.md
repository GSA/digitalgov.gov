title: Developing an easier way to recruit user research participants
deck: "USAGov and the 10x program developed a user research recruitment page on
  USA.gov in February 2024 to streamline user research recruitment for federal
  programs. The page, which has attracted hundreds of sign-ups, allows
  participants to assist in testing government websites and match specific
  demographics, while compensating them with gift cards. By simplifying the
  process and expanding recruitment to diverse groups, the initiative aims to
  increase user research, with plans to include more languages and audiences in
  the future. "
