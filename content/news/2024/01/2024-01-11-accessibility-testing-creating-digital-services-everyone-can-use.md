title: Accessibility testing: creating digital services everyone can use
deck: "Ensuring USA.gov and USAGov en Espanol remains accessible to everyone is
  a top priority, with accessibility testing ingrained in the development
  process. This involves evaluating the digital platforms for usability by
  individuals with various disabilities, spanning visual, auditory, physical,
  cognitive, and neurological challenges. From manual testing with assistive
  technologies to automated scans and valuable input from individuals with
  disabilities, the approach is comprehensive. Early integration, diverse
  testing methods, and adherence to accessibility guidelines, such as Web
  Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), are pivotal in creating a more
  inclusive and equitable digital space. "
