title: "Federal customer experience: OMB has taken actions to implement
  cross-agency priority goals"
deck: "The 2021 President’s Management Agenda prioritizes enhancing federal
  customer experience, leading the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to set
  two long-term goals: improving service experiences and key life events
  involving multiple agencies. OMB has made strides in implementing these goals,
  including establishing a federal customer experience management team and
  working with High Impact Services Providers (HIPs) to collect and report
  customer feedback data. Additionally, OMB has created cross-agency teams to
  focus on specific life experiences and developed a performance framework to
  track progress towards these goals."
