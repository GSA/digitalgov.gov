title: Back to basics in the age of AI
deck: The federal government is actively discussing the transformative potential
  of artificial intelligence (AI), with agencies like 18F focusing on the
  opportunities and risks involved. While AI can automate tasks and enhance data
  analysis, it also presents challenges such as bias and ethical concerns. To
  navigate this landscape, 18F leverages existing design practices, addresses
  power dynamics, minimizes bias, and anticipates potential harms, ensuring AI
  is used responsibly and effectively in government operations.
