The U.S. government is arguably one of the largest, most complex service delivery organizations in the world, responsible for a wide range of services. Every interaction between the government and the American public is an opportunity to deliver the services our people expect and deserve. And when we don’t, that’s a cost to our nation.

In both the private and public sectors, designers have often focused on creating experiences that work for the “average person,” sometimes at the expense of people that need something different. Civic designers fundamentally believe in incorporating the public’s perspectives in policy development, decision-making, and co-design of public solutions and services. However, too often, we miss the mark. A more intentional, equity-focused approach to Human-Centered Design (HCD) methods is needed to truly enable all voices to be heard in the creation and implementation of government.

[Read in detail](https://digital.gov/resources/embedding-equity-in-civic-design-to-transform-customer-experience/?dg) how we as designers in the federal government are leveraging design methods to help build a foundation for improved customer experiences for all people through a new call to action: [Executive Order (13985) On Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/) — and where we must go from here.
