title: Creating a New Way for People To Discover Government Benefits
deck: "**Creating a New Way for People To Discover Government
  Benefits**&mdash;To make it even easier for everyone to find services and
  benefits without needing to understand government structure, we’re developing
  a new digital tool in partnership with 10x, GSA’s incremental technology fund.
  BEARS, the Benefits Eligibility Awareness Resource Service, is an important
  step forward in providing an integrated, simple solution for federal benefits
  to improve the customer experience and will eventually cover all federal
  benefits from all agencies."
