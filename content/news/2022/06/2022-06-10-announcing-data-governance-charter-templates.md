title: Announcing Data Governance Charter Templates
deck: "**Announcing Data Governance Charter Templates**&mdash;As a part of our Resources and Advisory Support collection, the Data and Analytics (DA) team in the Centers of Excellence (CoE) has released three charter templates that can help federal agencies set up data governance groups and an Office of the Chief Data Officer. We developed these charter templates based on our experiences working with chief data officers (CDOs) and data practitioners across the federal government. These charters are designed to help federal government agencies set up data governance bodies to better use agency data securely and strategically. Although the charter templates don’t represent or constitute official guidance, they’ll help jump start your effort to build data governance structures within your agency. Tailor them to meet your agency’s specific needs."
