title: C-SCRM Acquisition Community of Practice (ACoP) Interact Site
deck: "**C-SCRM Acquisition Community of Practice (ACoP) Interact
  Site**&mdash;Since the launch of the Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk
  Management (C-SCRM) Acquisition Community of Practice (ACoP), GSA and the
  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) have been co-leading
  an effort to broaden the level of awareness and develop agency maturity in the
  areas of acquisitions, supply chain risk management, and cybersecurity across
  the federal government for information communication technology and services
  (ICTS). To increase C-SCRM awareness and adoption government-wide, the C-SCRM
  ACoP launched an online collaborative space for the federal government’s IT
  community and industry to share best practices, ideas, guidance, tools, and
  expertise needed to implement C-SCRM requirements. Working together as a
  community and sharing information will help us improve our cybersecurity
  posture across all levels of government."
