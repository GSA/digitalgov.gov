title: The 18F Engineering Sandwich for Cloud-based Web Apps
deck: "**The 18F Engineering Sandwich for Cloud-based Web Apps**&mdash;18F Engineering is often thought of as a technology shop, but that's too broad. There are very few technology choices we actually make at the project level, so, more often than not, we combine a limited set of technologies to make our applications. To explain this, we'll use the metaphor of a sandwich shop."
