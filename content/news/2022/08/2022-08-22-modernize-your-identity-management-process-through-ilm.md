title: Modernize Your Identity Management Process Through ILM
deck: "**Modernize Your Identity Management Process Through ILM**&mdash;GSA’s
  Office of Government-wide Policy is pleased to announce the Identity Lifecycle
  Management (ILM) Playbook, designed for identity program managers, and
  enterprise and application architects interested in modernizing their identity
  management process for federal employees. This practical guide helps federal
  agencies understand how to shift their focus from managing employee access
  based on credentials to managing the lifecycle of identities as outlined in
  section III of OMB Memo 19-17. This will help agencies achieve an enterprise
  Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) system that is agile enough
  to support technology modernization and aligns with the Federal Identity,
  Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) architecture."
