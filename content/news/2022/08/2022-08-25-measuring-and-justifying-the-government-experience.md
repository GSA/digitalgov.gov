title: Measuring and Justifying the Government Experience
deck: "**Measuring and Justifying the Government Experience**&mdash;Private
  sector organizations use revenue as the primary measurement to justify
  improving experiences. Many government services don’t have revenue as a lever,
  so how can we justify work to improve experience? The Office of Natural
  Resources Revenue (ONRR) leveraged a few metrics on their team that fall into
  three categories: laws and regulations, improving the experience for users,
  and saving time for employees."
