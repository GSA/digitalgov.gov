2021, what a year!

Despite the real challenges we as a nation faced in 2021, [Digital.gov’s communities](https://digital.gov/communities/) held strong.

We would like to thank our community leads and members for partnering with us throughout the year to provide engaging events, content, and discussion forums to those interested in digital transformation.

Digital.gov’s mission is to transform how the federal government learns, builds, delivers, and measures digital services to the public. We have been organizing communities for more than 20 years, starting with the first in-person meeting of the Web Managers community on October 31, 2000. Fast forward to 2021, and all Digital.gov community events were held virtually for the first year ever.

We hosted **65 events** with a total of **16,157 attendees**. We held events and published articles in celebration of National Hispanic Heritage Month, Global Accessibility Awareness Day, and International Plain Language Day. Digital.gov events averaged **249 attendees** per event with satisfaction scores averaging 4.5 out of 5. We also held dozens of other community meetings, like huddles — where we engaged with smaller groups on topics like organizational change and communication techniques.

The pandemic showed us how important communities are for people to be able to connect with like-minded peers in a virtual environment when the office space and in-person gatherings as we know it were stripped away. So, we quickly learned how to best collaborate through a computer monitor, bringing together experts, newbies, and those in between, to learn more about digital transformation. We blogged, tweeted, and posted our ideas, best practices, and success stories. We used our networks to crowdsource solutions to digital challenges.

We helped each other, and we made it through another year together. Here are some of the highlights from 2021.
