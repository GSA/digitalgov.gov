A committee of government employees will review the submissions and select the presentations for the program based on the relevance, usefulness, and quality of the submission and qualifications of the presenters. We expect to finalize the program in May.

## Accessibility Guidelines

If the submission is selected for the 2022 UX Summit, Digital.gov will provide guidance on creating accessible slides and presentations. The submitter agrees to meet federal accessibility requirements for written materials and presentations. Read our [tips for accessible events](https://github.com/GSA/digitalgov.gov/wiki/Accessible-Event-Tips) for more information.

## Evaluation Process 

By submitting a presentation for review, the submitter, and panelists agree to the UX Summit review process. A committee composed of government employee volunteers will review all submissions.

{{< accordion kicker="2022 Government UX Summit" title="Evaluation Considerations" icon="" >}} To make the final selections, the reviewers will consider the following for each submission:

1. Relevance to the UX Community of Practice
2. Usefulness of the presentation
3. Quality of the submission
4. Qualifications of the speakers and submitters
5. Appropriateness of the content for the proposed session length (we may suggest changes)

**NOTE:** In addition to considering these criteria, the reviewers will strive to achieve a diverse, balanced, and equitable program for the Summit.
