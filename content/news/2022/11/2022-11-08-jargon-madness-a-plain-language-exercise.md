Federal plain writing practitioners may find it hard to engage with their colleagues, and formal plain language training programs can sometimes be a difficult sell to leadership.

One agency developed an entertaining exercise to promote plain language practices by focusing on a common enemy of the plain writer: jargon.

Laura Rabuck, a research health science specialist and lead content strategist at the Veterans Health Administration, created a "Jargon Madness" tournament-style bracket. It’s modeled after a similar annual college basketball-themed bracket. In this version, jargon battles for the title of “Most confusing” based on votes.

Jargon Madness is a plain language conversation starter that cuts across the organizational chart. It offers engagement and education. Unlike a meeting or a scheduled training, it’s a fun, asynchronous activity that staff can participate in when they have time.

If you want to host a Jargon Madness event at your agency, consider the following: 

* Confirm **leadership buy-in** and if there’s an **audience**.
* Confirm your **champions/sponsors** and **partners**.
* Confirm **staffing support**.
* Confirm **language** with your general counsel.
* Decide **bracket size** and corresponding **timeline**.
* Decide (and test) where you’ll **host** it and how **voting** will work.
* Decide how to **identify jargon**.
* Develop a **marketing plan**, however small (but mighty!).
* Research and draft ideas for **education**.
* Decide on **post-event survey**.

Start now! Next March will arrive quickly.
