title: "Closing the Disability Divide "
deck: >
  Over 67 million people in the United States have a disability, constituting
  the largest diversity group in the country. Despite decades of advocacy and
  struggle, people with disabilities continue to experience significant gaps in
  health and well-being, educational attainment, employment, and wealth compared
  to people without disabilities. These gaps have been termed the “disability
  divide.” The purpose of this year’s National Disability Employment Awareness
  campaign at the National Institutes of Health is to educate staff regarding
  the divide and to celebrate those who help close the disability divide by
  advocating for people with disabilities.
