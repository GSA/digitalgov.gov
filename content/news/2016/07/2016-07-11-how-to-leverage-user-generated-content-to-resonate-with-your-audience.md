**User-Generated Content** (UGC) is a buzzword as of late, popularized recently due to the ever increasing demand for new content. To define the phrase, let’s look to a shining example of it,Wikipedia, as a source, &#8220;**any form of content** such as [blogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog "Blog"), [wikis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki "Wiki"), [discussion forums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum "Discussion forum"), [posts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_post "Internet post - page does not exist"), [chats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_chat "Online chat"),[tweets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter "Twitter"), [podcasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast "Podcast"), digital images, video, audio files, advertisements, and other forms of media that was created by **users** of an online system or service, often made available via [social media websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_social_networking_websites "List of social networking websites").&#8221; {{< legacy-img src="2016/07/600-x-400-color-edits-Communication-concept-network-VLADGRIN-iStock-Thinkstock-480561776.jpg" alt="Communication concept network." caption="" >}} 

Whether it’s [sharing relevant content to your brand](https://twitter.com/wernerc/status/746348823186808832) with your audience, or posting [guest blogs from influencers or subject matter experts](https://theiacpblog.org/2016/07/05/lets-all-be-a-player-police-legitimacy-and-youth-engagement-results/), we probably all implement user-generated content into our strategy in some way these days. Well, at least there are many reasons we should be.

Across all sectors &#8211; state, local, federal governments, NGO’s, non-profit, private sector &#8211; **if you are in the communication business**, **you are in the content-creation business**. Websites and social media channels that we use as a vehicle to get our message across, constantly demand updating. But in an effort to constantly feed the content machine, we can sometimes get caught off message.

Recently, _Newscred_, a content marketing software company, held the [#ThinkContent Summit](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ThinkContent&src=typd) 2016, and discovered from a survey of 463 attendees that there is a major disconnect between what marketers spend their time, budget, and resources creating compared to what they themselves actually want as a consumer.

This [How Marketers Create and Consume Content infographic on their website](http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fimages3.newscred.com%2FZz1lNGFiMzYxMzRhYTE0NThmOTc1MjhkOTQ4NWRmNzUyYQ%3D%3D&t=YmZhNzhlMDAxYWUyMTkwNjNhOTQ3OTFlMWU3OTBiMmUyZDY2ZDk4YyxUcWlBMlFxNA%3D%3D) says it all &#8211; **Keep the CONSUMER first**.

So why the disconnect? It seems that, perhaps, **sometimes when we get so involved in &#8220;doing our job&#8221; we can forget the point of &#8220;why&#8221; we do it**. Using UGC you can get audience participation, and hope to have loyal brand followers as a result. **At the core of its definition, user-generated content is about being audience-oriented**, involving them in expressing the interests of your brand. And isn’t that what we should all strive to do &#8211; connect better with our audience to drive actionable results?

Just a few other benefits of UGC include:

  * Additional streams of content to populate your content calendar
  * Learning about your audience
  * Staying relevant to your audience

**Influencer marketing** is one example of UGC that is trending, especially in the private sector with large companies seeking YouTube influencers, for example, to develop branded videos. But, keep in mind, whatever the tactic—

> _&#8220;[Authenticity is key &#8211; if you don’t believe what someone is telling you and you don’t think they are being genuine or telling the truth, then it means nothing.](http://www.socialmediatoday.com/marketing/influencer-marketing-collaboration-not-transaction)&#8221; – Dan Neale, Social Media Today_

As previously stated on [The Content Corner]({{< ref "/topics/the-content-corner" >}}), &#8220;[users (especially Millennials) demand authenticity from any brand/entity/agency they interact with]({{< ref "2015-09-21-the-content-corner-harness-the-power-of-user-generated-content.md" >}}).&#8221; So, whatever the tactic, be genuine!

There are many ideas for how to implement user-generated content into your content strategy. I’ve gathered several case studies from across the government, to provide a glimpse at some of the many ways agencies are seeing the value in UGC.

To highlight community policing efforts in action, the Community Oriented Policing Services Office hosts a [Community Policing in Action](http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/photocontest) photo contest to celebrate examples of community policing and showcase the work of American law enforcement.

{{< legacy-img src="2016/07/600-x-172-Community-Policing-2016-Photo-Contest_WebBanner.jpg" alt="Community Policing 2016 Photo Contest banner." >}}<figure class="tmblr-full"></figure> _National Archives_, through the _National Archives Foundation_, hosted a [#ArchivesJuly4 Transcribe-a-thon](https://www.archivesfoundation.org/event/archivesjuly4-transcribe-thon/) where participants using their computers on site, helped to unlock info to put in the records on the National Archives’ online catalog.

Earlier this year, the _National Institutes of Health_ [held a data call]({{< ref "2016-06-13-nih-image-gallery-data-call-success.md" >}}) highlighting NIH-funded scientific research to help populate their [centralized image service](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/images) for the dissemination of primarily scientific, biomedical, and disease related imagery. Their efforts were deemed successful as they received over 50 image submissions from 24 different funded institutions.

Crowdsourcing can be another tactic to reach out for user-generated content. [Challenge.gov](https://www.challenge.gov/) has many good examples of successful crowdsourcing efforts to accomplish solutions to problems, and leverage the talent of the citizens we serve.

By providing an incentive, in this case cash and other prizes, Challenge.gov receives useful solutions:

Last week, the _Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration_ completed a challenge for [participants to create a mobile app](http://www.samhsa.gov/newsroom/press-announcements/201603041100) to provide opioid recovery support for patients. They provided tiered prizes for up to eight participants, with the top app developer receiving $15,000.<figure class="tmblr-full">{{< legacy-img src="2016/07/600-x-80-SAMHSA-Opioid-Recovery-App-Challenge-banner.jpg" alt="SAMHSA Opioid Recovery App Challenge banner." >}}</figure> 

The [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/) and [National Capital Planning Commission](https://www.ncpc.gov/) recently completed an ideas competition called [Memorials of the Future](https://future.ncpc.gov/), with the goal of site-specific designs for memorials in Washington, DC. One submission virtualized National Parks using ultra-high definition videos and audio recordings through an interactive, immersive installation.

Similar to Challenge.gov, [CitizenScience.gov](http://www.citizenscience.gov/) is designed to accelerate the use of crowdsourcing and citizen science across the U.S. government. At the time this piece was written, 301 projects represented by 25 agencies are live and mapped in their [virtual catalog](http://www.citizenscience.gov/catalog/).

In an effort to increase “surface observations” [NOAA’s National Severe Storms Laboratory](http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/) recently announced, “Summer Spotlight: [mPING!](https://www.citizenscience.gov/2016/07/06/noaa-summer-spotlight-mping/ "Permanent Link to NOAA Summer Spotlight: mPING!")” a [crowdsourcing project](https://ccsinventory.wilsoncenter.org/#projectId/24) to collect public weather reports through a free app available for smartphones and mobile devices.
