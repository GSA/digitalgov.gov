****We have previously written about [microsites in the federal government]({{< ref "2016-04-21-microsites.md" >}}). A microsite is a small collection of web pages—a subset of an organization’s full website. Partners can embed microsites that present [curated information]({{< ref "2015-11-09-the-content-corner-structured-content-and-the-power-of-syndication.md" >}}) on a specific topic or campaign directly within their own websites. And perhaps best of all, microsites that are [API]({{< ref "/topics/api" >}})-enabled are maintained and updated by the source organization so that when updates are made, those updates are automatically made on partner sites in real time.

And now, here is another great example.

Recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) have partnered to produce a new microsite on Summer Health and Safety. Some of the topics covered include: food safety, water and sun safety, and the prevention of mosquito and tick-borne diseases.

To get the latest summer health and safety information for your websites, [preview and grab the embed code](https://tools.cdc.gov/medialibrary/index.aspx#/microsite/id/280182) for this microsite at CDC’s [Public Health Media Library](https://tools.cdc.gov/medialibrary). Please share with anyone you think might be interested in this valuable [portable content]({{< ref "2016-05-05-how-to-create-portable-content-with-structured-content-models.md" >}}). Examples of the Summer Health and Safety microsite syndication in use include:

  * The [Public Health Department](http://www.buchanancountyiowa.org/services/public_health/summer_health_and_safety.php) for Buchanan County, IA
  * [Avon Grove Regional Emergency Management](http://www.myagrem.net/Resources/CDCSubscriptions/summerweather.php) in Chester County, PA
