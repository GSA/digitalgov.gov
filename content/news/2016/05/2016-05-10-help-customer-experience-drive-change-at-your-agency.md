With the recent launch of the [Core Federal Services Council](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m-16-08.pdf)—which seeks to improve the customer experience for core federal programs by ensuring use of customer feedback data and identifying strategies—building on the [Feedback USA pilot]({{< ref "2015-01-12-15-government-customer-service-trends-for-2015.md" >}}), the [Federal Front Door](https://labs.usa.gov/) and other [customer experience initiatives](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/04/26/thinking-about-the-future-of-the-post-office-an-interview-with-amanda-weaver/), 2016 may in fact be the [Year of the Customer]({{< ref "2014-12-01-will-2016-be-the-federal-governments-year-of-the-customer.md" >}}).

But, how do we ensure these efforts can build momentum and lead to meaningful change in government?

This month we’ll take a look at a variety of ways this change is occurring and the agents helping ensure the customer’s voice is heard:

  * How to build genuine relationships with stakeholders by [refining messages and tactics based on feedback]({{< ref "2016-05-09-the-content-corner-using-content-as-a-tool-for-improving-citizen-services.md" >}})
  * How the USDA’s working to improve how customer experience information is disseminated to their front-line employees
  * A look at the CX initiatives happening at GSA from its Chief Customer Service Officer
  * An in-depth look at the new Core Federal Services Council and how it will help agencies improve their customer experience
  * A look at the [importance of balancing external and internal customer experience metrics]({{< ref "2016-05-16-customer-experience-performance-metrics-two-sides-to-every-story.md" >}})

You can also check out the [Customer Experience Toolkit]({{< ref "customer-experience-toolkit.md" >}}), a library of case studies, tools and and agency examples that will help you improve your customer&#8217;s experience.
