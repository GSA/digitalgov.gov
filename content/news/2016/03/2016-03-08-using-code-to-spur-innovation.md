This week, President Obama will [travel to SxSW (South by Southwest)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/03/05/weekly-address-sxsw) to talk about how we can use technology to tackle tough challenges. This underscores how important data—government data, in particular—is to improving and fueling our democracy forward. 2015 saw many [open data milestones](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/02/05/open-data-empowering-americans-make-data-driven-decisions) by agencies, including:

  * [New advancements in HHS’s syndication storefront]({{< ref "2015-12-21-with-collaboration-comes-great-things.md" >}})
  * New features to [analytics.usa.gov]({{< ref "2015-12-01-analytics-usa-gov-new-features-and-more-data.md" >}}) dashboard (now with [agency-specific dashboards]({{< ref "2016-02-18-analytics-usa-gov-now-with-agency-specific-dashboards.md" >}})

  * APIs from [FEC]({{< ref "2015-07-09-introducing-the-federal-election-commissions-first-api.md" >}}) , [Labor]({{< ref "2015-07-01-safety-and-transparency-through-data.md" >}}) and [NASA]({{< ref "2015-05-27-the-api-briefing-nasa-builds-api-nasa-gov-to-launch-more-apis-to-developers.md" >}}) ([to name a few]({{< ref "/topics/wednesday-api-briefing" >}}))

There is also more to come (and more that’s needed). This month on DigitalGov we’ll take a look at what else agencies are working on, including:

  * How a [new agency addition to DAP impacts analytics.usa.gov]({{< ref "2016-03-22-the-postal-service-just-broke-analytics-usa-gov.md" >}})

  * An argument for the [idea that good content can trump good code]({{< ref "2016-03-28-the-content-corner-code-is-a-tool-content-is-the-solution.md" >}})
  * [DOT&#8217;s request for schedule data]({{< ref "2016-03-24-dot-seeking-data-for-new-national-transit-map.md" >}}) to feed new National Transit Map
  * How the [CFPB’s data analysts normalize location data]({{< ref "2016-03-11-seeing-states-the-right-way-how-to-weigh-data-by-population.md" >}}) and use [tag management]({{< ref "2016-03-31-tag-management-a-digital-analysts-best-friend.md" >}})
  * A look at the [mobile development community&#8217;s debate]({{< ref "2016-03-09-the-data-briefing-mobile-websites-or-mobile-apps-or-both.md" >}}) over mobile apps vs. mobile websites
