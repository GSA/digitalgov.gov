Social Security joins you and your family in celebrating [Hispanic Heritage Month](http://www.hispanicheritagemonth.gov/), which runs from September 15 to October 15.

We know the contributions of Hispanics can be traced to before the origins of the United States with the discovery, exploration, and naming of many places in our nation, such as state names like California, Colorado, and Texas and city names like San Antonio, Santa Barbara, and Boca Raton. Hispanics have influenced every facet of life, from language to our cultural development. Hispanics play a crucial role in American life.<span id="more-1828"></span>

The most important things to you are your family and maintaining the feeling of individuality through your language. That’s why Social Security provides a website —<span lang="es" title="Spanish"><a href="http://www.segurosocial.gov/" target="_blank">www.segurosocial.gov</a></span> — with a variety of publications and services in Spanish that are important to you and your family.

If you need to apply for your first Social Security number or a get a replacement Social Security card, we invite you to read our publications _<a href="https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10023.pdf" target="_blank">Social Security Numbers for Children</a>_ and _<a href="https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10002.pdf" target="_blank">Your Social Security Number and Card</a>_.

We offer a toll free number, 1-800-772-1213, which provides automated instructions for Spanish speakers. We also try to have employees available on the phone and in many of our offices who speak Spanish. However, if you need an interpreter, you can go to <span lang="es" title="Spanish"><a href="http://www.segurosocial.gov/espanol/interpreter.htm" target="_blank">www.segurosocial.gov/espanol/interpreter.htm</a></span> to find out more about our free interpreter services.

Just as grandparents help guide their grandchildren through life’s journey, we at Social Security are with you throughout yours. The services we provide guide you through your journey from birth, with your first social security card, to your dream of a secure retirement.

You don’t have to wait to find out what your retirement benefits may be.
