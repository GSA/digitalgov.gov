On September 8, 2016 Administrator Denise Turner Roth of the [U.S. General Services Administration](http://www.gsa.gov/) (GSA) hosted the first-ever Technology Industry Day to provide a better understanding of GSA’s path to improve the government’s outdated technology systems. The event featured how GSA buys, builds and shares technology for the federal government.

"The General Services Administration has a long history of being a strong leader in adopting technology in government," said Administrator Roth when giving her opening remarks at GSA's Technology Industry Day.

Breakout sessions provided a more intimate discussion between government and industry on technology topics such as **Acquisitions in Tech**, **TTS as a Proving Ground** and **TTS for the Future**. Presenters highlighted how the [Technology Transformation Service](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/25729) (TTS) and the [Federal Acquisition Services](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/105080) (FAS) are working together with industry to transform technology in the federal space.

Vendors also had the opportunity to view demos of current projects.

We have the technology to change that and we, at GSA, want to be an integral part of making that change,” said Administrator Roth.
