The simplest of our four requirements was to allow customers to choose whether to use the <tt>search.usa.gov</tt> domain for their search results page, or create a “masked” domain name such as <tt>search.someagency.gov</tt>. While only about 1/4 of customer agencies use them, half of our search traffic comes through masked domains. {{< legacy-img src="2016/08/600-x-400-Search-bar-on-virtual-screen-Gajus-iStock-Thinkstock-178761722.jpg" alt="Search bar on virtual screen." caption="" >}} 

In our previous infrastructure, the customer would create a [CNAME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record) in their own DNS zone to point <tt>search.someagency.gov</tt> to the edge servers for <tt>search.usa.gov</tt>, and we had to register the customer’s domain mask with our DNS provider. All our customers used the same CNAME: <tt>search.usa.gov.old-cdn-waf-provider.net</tt>

We knew that we wanted to avoid a “Big Bang” migration event in which all of our customers were suddenly pointed to the new AWS hosting infrastructure, so we asked our CNAME customers to point their agency-specific hostnames to customer-specific CNAMEs. This would allow us to shift traffic around on a customer-by-customer basis &#8211; both to the new infrastructure, but also back to the old infrastructure if the need arose:

<tt>$ORIGIN someagency.gov.<br /> search IN CNAME someagency.sites.infr.search.usa.gov</tt>

Once a fair number of our customers had these CNAMEs in place, we were able to switch them over to our new AWS infrastructure one-at-a-time rather than switching everyone at once:

<tt>$ORIGIN sites.infr.search.usa.gov.<br /> earlyadopteragency IN CNAME aws.search.usa.gov<br /> anotherearlyadopteragency IN CNAME aws.search.usa.gov<br /> notchangingnowagency IN CNAME old-infra.search.usa.gov</tt>

The snippet above is a bit of a simplification, however. We used [wildcard DNS records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_DNS_record) at first to direct the majority of our customers to our previous hosting provider, and then later to our AWS-hosted site:

**Before:**
  
<tt>$ORIGIN sites.infr.search.usa.gov.<br /> earlyadopteragency IN CNAME aws.search.usa.gov<br /> anotherdaringagency IN CNAME aws.search.usa.gov<br /> ; All customers above will go to the new infrastructure<br /> * IN CNAME old-infra.search.usa.gov</tt>

**Later:**
  
<tt>$ORIGIN sites.infr.search.usa.gov.<br /> * IN CNAME aws.search.usa.gov<br /> ; All customers below will go to the old infrastructure<br /> notchangingnowagency IN CNAME old-infra.search.usa.gov</tt>

**Finally:**
  
<tt>$ORIGIN sites.infr.search.usa.gov.<br /> ; Everyone goes to the new infrastructure<br /> * IN CNAME aws.search.usa.gov</tt>

At any step in this process, we were always able to go back to our zone file and add a customer-specific CNAME to direct traffic as needed for that customer, but eventually the DNS migration came to an end and we were left with just the single wildcard record <tt>*.sites.infr.search.usa.gov</tt> pointing to our AWS infrastructure.
