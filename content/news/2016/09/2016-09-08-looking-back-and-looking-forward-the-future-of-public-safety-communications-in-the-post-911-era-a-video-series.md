> “When I was deployed to the Trade Center on 9&#47;11, my first 12 hours were spent trying to get communications established.”—Mike Worrell

In the video below, FirstNet’s Mike Worrell talks about the communication challenges he faced as a first responder on 9/11 at the World Trade Center. Cell phone systems weren’t working, video of the incident couldn’t be shared, and Worrell and his fellow first responders had to wait 12-14 hours after data collection get access to key data. In the future, Worrell says, FirstNet will provide real-time data collection and situational awareness so vital to effective first response.
