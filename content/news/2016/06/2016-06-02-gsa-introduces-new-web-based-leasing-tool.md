Recently, Regional Administrator Sara Manzano-Díaz of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) introduced a web-based leasing tool, the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), to 60 lessors and/or brokers at the Dow Building in Philadelphia. The AAAP tool was designed to consolidate and streamline the leasing process, making for a more efficient, transparent process that also gets the best deal for the American taxpayer.

Ms. Manzano-Diaz said that the AAAP will transform how the GSA Mid-Atlantic Region conducts its leasing by transitioning the system to an electronic platform that will serve as the primary procurement vehicle for GSA  to acquire office space.  In the Philadelphia area, GSA spends $124 million a year to lease over 5.5 million square feet of space, and within the next three years, there will be 72 expiring leases.

Ms. Manzano-Diaz said, ”The launch of this online tool helps GSA achieve better value and savings, serve our partners and make a more sustainable government.”

In response to a Request for Lease Proposal, building owners and/or brokers can electronically submit lease offers through the AAAP website at [https://aaap.gsa.gov](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/168395). Awards are made through AAAP to the lowest-priced building that can accommodate the government’s needs in terms of square footage, technical requirements, length of lease term and delineated area.

There will be additional AAAP Industry Days held in Baltimore, Norfolk, Richmond, Martinsburg, Charleston, Pittsburgh and Harrisburg.
