  The report said that since 2012, the percentage of Hispanic adults who used mobile devices to access the Internet jumped from 76% to 94% in 2015. These percentages are higher than both white and African American usage in the same years.

  Pew researchers said, “While Latinos have lagged other groups in accessing the internet and having broadband at home, they have been among the most likely to own a smartphone, to live in a household without a landline phone where only a cellphone is available</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> and to access the internet from a mobile device.”</p>

    This is a very large audience with more than 55 million Hispanics living in the U.S.; it’s also one of the fastest growing and youngest groups—with </span><a href="http://www.pewhispanic.org/2016/04/20/the-nations-latino-population-is-defined-by-its-youth/"><span style="font-weight: 400">more than half under the age of 18</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</p> {{< legacy-img src="2014/05/600-x-400-Friends-Looking-At-Cell-Phone-Ridofranz-iStock-Thinkstock-166121799.jpg" alt="Young Hispanic millennials looking at cell phones" caption="" >}}

      Along with the increased audience size, the demand for Spanish content has increased with bilingual and Spanish dominant speakers accounting for 86% and 74% of the Latino audience, respectively.
