A new report from the Mobile Ecosystem Forum shows that [most users delete apps because of security concerns](http://www.marketingcharts.com/online/1-in-2-mobile-users-say-theyve-deleted-an-app-over-privacy-concerns-69647/attachment/mefavg-actions-taken-response-to-app-privacy-concerns-aug2016/).

The report also said that 47% of survey respondents would pay extra for an app that didn’t share personal information and that the inability to find a privacy policy is one of the leading reasons for consumers losing trust in an app. {{< legacy-img src="2016/08/600-x-400-backdoor-Somebody-is-watching-all-our-data-BeeBright-iStock-Thinkstock-576581592.jpg" alt="Open back door to a data stream, with eyes watching." caption="" >}} 

Privacy requirements aren’t just a &#8220;nice to have&#8221; for government agencies; including a privacy policy in all of your digital sites and apps is a new requirement from [OMB Circular A-130 that was recently released]({{< ref "2016-07-27-managing-federal-information-as-a-strategic-resource.md" >}}).

Besides privacy concerns, app purging seems to be a growing trend among thought leaders; Walt Mossberg, long-time tech writer for The Wall Street Journal, Recode and now, The Verge, [recently posted about his app purge](http://www.theverge.com/2016/7/20/12231176/walt-mossberg-delete-your-unnecessary-apps) and encouraged more people to do it. Even Apple is loosening up and [letting users uninstall some of their stock apps](http://www.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11923112/apple-ios-10-delete-stock-apps) that have never been deletable with the new version of iOS 10.

Installing individual apps isn’t a necessity anymore with the maturation and adoption of responsive web design standards. Plus, messaging apps and messaging bots are beginning to replace individual apps: you can do things like get new headlines, send money, or [call an Uber](https://techcrunch.com/2015/12/16/facebook-messenger-transportation/) within a shared service now.

Research and trend reports have shown us for years that  [most people only regularly use a few apps, while they have dozens installed]({{< ref "2015-10-27-trends-on-tuesday-users-spend-most-of-their-time-in-social-apps.md" >}}).

The app retention climb continues to be a steep hill for many government agencies and is something to strongly consider when [deciding what metrics you’ll use to evaluate success]({{< ref "2016-05-12-using-pirate-metrics-to-analyze-your-mobile-applications-audience.md" >}}) before jumping into app development.
