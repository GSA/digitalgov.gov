> **Summary**: Today, we’re launching the M3 Framework to provide agencies with leading best practices for mission-support function modernizations and migrations.

The government’s internal operations have a powerful impact on service to its citizens, and this Administration has made transformation of management practices within the Federal Government a key priority. By [sharing and streamlining mission support services](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/05/04/continuing-shared-services-momentum) and [retiring or modernizing inefficient legacy IT systems](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/04/08/improving-and-modernizing-federal-cybersecurity), we’re better able to overcome the challenges of large-scale mission support projects, support core agency missions, and make our IT infrastructure more secure – all while achieving a more efficient, secure, and effective government for the American people. {{< legacy-img src="2016/08/600-x-400-Washington-DC-Capitol-dome-detail-with-waving-american-flag-Andrea-Izzotti-iStock-Thinkstock-513647471.jpg" alt="Washington DC Capitol dome detail with waving american flag." caption="" >}}

Recognizing the need to provide agencies with leading practices during mission-support function modernizations and migrations, the General Service Administration’s (GSA) Unified Shared Services Management (USSM) office developed the Modernization and Migration Management (M3) Framework. The M3 Framework, [released today](https://www.ussm.gov/m3/) on the [USSM.gov](https://www.ussm.gov/) website, includes an M3 Playbook and Investment Review Process, which together aim to increase the likelihood of success as agencies modernize and/or migrate their mission support functions such as financial management, human resources and acquisition.

The M3 Playbook provides customers and providers with the requisite activities to successfully navigate the modernization and/or migration journey. It was developed by incorporating leading practices and lessons learned from over 100 shared services experts across government agencies, industry and 28 Federal organizations. A “Chalk Talk” session was also hosted with over 77 participants from over 40 agencies to review and provide feedback on the M3 Framework.

The Investment Review Process helps the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) ensure the success of individual agency investments while also making sure those investments benefit the Federal Government as a whole and maximize the value to taxpayers. Using the M3 Playbook as a map, USSM, OMB, and other subject matter experts will work with agencies to assess and mitigate potential hurdles to success. The process ensures a more outcome and risk-based dialogue and provides greater transparency into costs and funding requirements for modernizations and migrations, achieving a Federal Government that is smarter, savvier and more effective in delivering for the American people.
