As localities struggle with issues such as the Zika virus and the Opioid epidemic, gathering and disseminating trustworthy information can be daunting.

But one group of Federal agencies and offices have come together to create a free and easy way to incorporate public health web content, images, video, microsites, data, and infographics into other sites, apps, and social media. {{< legacy-img src="2016/10/600-x-400-Woman-carrying-a-box-with-word.-Content-marketing-distribution-concept-zakokor-iStock-Thinkstock-72-dpi-536077001.jpg" alt="Woman carrying a box with word Content on it; a content marketing distribution concept." caption="" >}} 

Digital media syndication of science-based resources from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) can be combined with your ongoing activities and can help coordinate health messaging for maximum impact and reach.

The service is offered under the umbrella project called Content Services (CS) â€”a cumulative effort pulled together across HHS to disseminate information to other Federal Government agencies, state and local health departments, and the public.
