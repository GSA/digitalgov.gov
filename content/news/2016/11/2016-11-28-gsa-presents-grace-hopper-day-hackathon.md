The [U.S. General Services Administration](http://www.gsa.gov/) (GSA) Digital Service team is excited to be [hosting our next agency hackathon](http://open.gsa.gov/grace-hopper-hackathon/) on December 9, 2016. Join coders from across the region as we come together in celebration of Grace Hopper’s birthday. [Admiral “Amazing Grace” Hopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper) was one of the first programmers in the history of computers. As the creator of the first [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) for a p[rogramming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language), it is largely due to her that programmers use “if/thens” instead of 1s and 0s today.

The event is open to the public and being held in the [National Archives Innovation Hub](https://www.archives.gov/innovation-hub) in Washington, D.C. We will focus on diving into some open source code to redesign the GSA Open Technology portal, [open.gsa.gov](http://open.gsa.gov/). This site is the current developer portal for all GSA data, APIs, and source code open to the public. The goal is to create a more visually appealing, user-friendly, and engaging site. Cash prizes will be awarded to the greatest contributions. Bring your laptop, and come ready to hack!

This hackathon is beginner friendly! GSA DS staff will be onsite and available for project related assistance and guidance. We’d like to highly encourage women, non-binary, and other underrepresented groups in tech to attend.

[Rear Admiral Grace Hopper](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-queen-of-code/), also known as “Amazing Grace” and “the first lady of software,” was one of [21 Americans](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/11/16/president-obama-names-recipients-presidential-medal-freedom) awarded the [Presidential Medal of Freedom](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/11/22/celebrating-presidential-medal-freedom-winners-science-and-tech-garwin-hopper-and) by President Barack Obama on November 22, 2016. The Presidential Medal of Freedom is the Nation’s highest civilian honor, presented to individuals who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.
