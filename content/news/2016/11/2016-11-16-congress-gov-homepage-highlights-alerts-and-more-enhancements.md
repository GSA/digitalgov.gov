This has been an exciting and successful year for [**Congress.gov**](https://www.congress.gov/?loclr=bloglaw). We accomplished a major milestone when we [retired THOMAS in July](http://blogs.gov.gov/law/2016/07/time-to-say-goodbye-to-thomas/?loclr=bloglaw). Over the course of 2016, we completed a number of enhancements to Congress.gov. In April we [expanded quick search](http://blogs.gov.gov/law/2016/04/congress-gov-spring-cleaning-expanded-quick-search/?loclr=bloglaw) to include the [Congressional Record](https://www.congress.gov/quick-search/congressional-record?loclr=bloglaw), [Committee Reports](https://www.congress.gov/quick-search/committee-reports?loclr=bloglaw), [Nominations](https://www.congress.gov/quick-search/nominations?loclr=bloglaw), [Treaty Documents](https://www.congress.gov/quick-search/treaty-documents?loclr=bloglaw), and [Communications](https://www.congress.gov/quick-search/communications?loclr=bloglaw).

In May we launched several [new RSS feeds and email alerts](http://blogs.gov.gov/law/2016/05/new-email-alerts-and-rss-feeds-on-congress-gov/?loclr=bloglaw) and added [saved search email alerts](http://blogs.gov.gov/law/2016/06/new-saved-search-email-alerts-on-congress-gov/?loclr=bloglaw) soon after in June. This is a feature that was never available on THOMAS. Also [added in June](http://blogs.gov.gov/law/2016/06/new-congress-gov-enhancements-including-advanced-search/?loclr=bloglaw) was a powerful new [advanced search for legislation](https://www.congress.gov/advanced-search/legislation?loclr=bloglaw). This search form provides greater access to the underlying data than was available on THOMAS. The September release [added new nomination alerts](http://blogs.gov.gov/law/2016/09/recess-revisions-congress-gov-clean-up-and-enhancements/?loclr=bloglaw) and provided more consistency across the site.

With today’s update we have added additional items that users have requested. We frequently get questions on how to contact your member of Congress. There is now a prominent section for contacting your member. Another addition is the Recent section circled below. The first link for [Yesterday in Congress](https://www.congress.gov/bills-with-chamber-action/browse-by-date?loclr=bloglaw) was a favorite on THOMAS that users missed.

Occasionally, we receive requests for a function that is already available on Congress.gov. There is now a featured Search Tip to share and highlight such items. You can also subscribe to search tips from the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/rss?loclr=bloglaw" rel="nofollow">RSS and Email Alerts</a> page.

Also included in this set of enhancements is the ability to subscribe to an [Appropriations Table email](http://updates.gov.gov/accounts/USLOC/subscriber/new?topic_id=USLOC_152) from that same <a href="https://www.congress.gov/rss?loclr=bloglaw" rel="nofollow">RSS and Email Alerts</a> page.

See [Congress.gov Enhancements](https://www.congress.gov/about/enhancements?loclr=bloglaw) for the complete rundown of this release. The page also provides a nice overview of all the enhancements since the site’s [launch back in September 2012](http://blogs.gov.gov/law/2012/09/introducing-congress-gov/?loclr=bloglaw).
