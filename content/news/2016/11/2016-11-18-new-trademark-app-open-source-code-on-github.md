Improving the way the government delivers information technology (IT) solutions to its customers isn’t just a goal, it’s our mission. We at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) know that by publishing our open source code, the public can help us come up with new and better IT solutions. In advance of the new <a class="ext extlink" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf" target="_blank">Federal Source Code Policy</a> and in support of the Administration’s <a class="ext extlink" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/open" target="_blank">Open Government Initiative</a>, we have been publishing <a class="ext extlink" href="https://github.com/USPTO/TrademarkStatusApp" target="_blank">content on GitHub</a> for over a year, and it now includes source code for a mobile application for trademarks.

The new <a class="ext extlink" href="https://github.com/USPTO/TrademarkStatusApp" target="_blank">published source code on GitHub</a> is for a sample application enabling a user to access and track the status of a trademark. This application enables the user to receive a push notification anytime the status of a trademark application changes. The idea for this app began with feedback from the leadership in Trademarks, and we believe that it will also be a useful tool for our own employees. We’re making our code for this application open to the public, so you can also use it in your own projects, improve it so it works best for you, or create an entirely new application.

Through our [Open Data and Mobility Program](https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/open-data-and-mobility), we’ve already <a class="ext extlink" href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/blog/2016/03/uspto-puts-data-hands-innovators" target="_blank">made over 200 years of intellectual property information available to the public</a>, and have published application program interfaces (APIs) so you can more easily search, use, and manipulate patent and trademark information. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to use our data.

As America’s Innovation Agency, we hope that our open source initiatives will spur innovation and create new ideas. We are looking to the public to come up with the next greatest idea, like we recently did through our <a class="ext extlink" href="https://medium.com/cancer-moonshot/unlocking-patent-data-to-spur-cancer-breakthroughs-26325501e9c2#.an3aeo699" target="_blank">Cancer Moonshot Challenge</a>.
