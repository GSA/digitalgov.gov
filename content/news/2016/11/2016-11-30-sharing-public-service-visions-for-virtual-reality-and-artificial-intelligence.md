I’m taking a break from sorting through dozens of concepts from federal agencies about how they want to use artificial intelligence and virtual reality for citizens in the coming months in order to share with you just some of these groundbreaking initiatives of tomorrow that can be explored at a DigitalGov University workshop this week.

We’re [launching our two new U.S. government-wide Communities]({{< ref "2016-10-26-gsa-launches-new-ai-virtual-reality-and-authentication-programs.md" >}}) — Artificial Intelligence for Citizen Services, and Virtual/Augmented Reality — with a workshop, creatively called the [_Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality for Federal Public Service Workshop_](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/artificial-intelligence-and-virtual-reality-for-federal-public-service-workshop-registration-29587821972), that brings together federal managers behind programs at more than 50 agencies with dozens of private sector teams ready to demo the technology that will drive our innovations together for years to come.

And while the workshop hasn’t happened yet, participants have already contributed plenty to start with:

> _Everything from creating immersive experiences that will deepen people-to-people international diplomacy, to converting digital customer service from social media to Alexa, Google Home and Siri_
>
> _Enhancing economic development for financial stability, health, education and housing, and designing emergency response exercises and decision support systems_
>
> _There’s some great ideas that involve the Grand Canyon, naturally_
>
> _Empowering researchers to interact with records that are too fragile or valuable to handle in person, making large amounts of biomedical data easier to navigate, and as one person puts it simply, “space exploration”_
>
> _Promoting interactive safety games that bring a whole new level of immersion to public service announcements, improving the veteran experience for wounded warriors, and revolutionizing education programs at all levels of development_

The list of achievable applications for both artificial intelligence and virtual/augmented reality in public service is growing, and our two new Communities will serve as the collaborative foundations for sharing information, analyzing trends, and connecting across government with the businesses ready to work with us.

While AI and VR are just two of the [16 official inter-agency Communities]({{< ref "/communities" >}}) we host with almost 10,000 memberships across the federal government, they both will need creative, new combinations of skill sets, training, and support — if you have something to contribute to these initiatives, I invite and encourage you to [reach out](mailto:justin.herman@gsa.gov). And if you can’t join us this time, we look forward to keeping your seat warm at the table for next time. The robots are coming.
