Google Product Director and author, Luke Wroblewski, wrote a piece about [how perfecting your Day 1 experience for users is critical](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1955) because retention after that point is incredibly difficult. {{< legacy-img src="2016/02/600-x-400-Woman-using-her-Mobile-Phone-Night-Light-Background-LDProd-iStock-Thinkstock-450947285.jpg" alt="Woman using her mobile phone, outside at night." caption="" >}} 

Wroblewski said that 25% of native mobile apps are abandoned after their first use and that the number of active users drops 77% in the first three days after installation.

To combat that drop off, he suggested focusing on your onboarding and the user’s first experience with the app through things like [gradual sign-ups](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1678), since many people will turn off completely when they hit that wall.

Each of those steps adds hurdles and is why it’s a risky and expensive proposition for government agencies unless they’re offering a specific experience that absolutely \*needs\* to be an app.

This steep climb and the difficulty to retain customers are core reasons I predicted that apps would lose some steam as mobile-optimized websites get better in [my government tech and mobile trends for 2016]({{< ref "2016-01-12-trends-on-tuesday-10-mobile-government-and-tech-trends-for-2016.md" >}}).
