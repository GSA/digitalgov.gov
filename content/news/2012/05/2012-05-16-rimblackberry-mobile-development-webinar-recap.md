The Mobile Platform Development Series was developed to help government agencies learn how to deliver government content&#8211;information, data and services&#8211;anytime, anywhere and on any device. One way to deliver content to citizens is via applications on mobile devices or native mobile apps. Government agencies need technical expertise on developing apps on the various platforms. Today we bring you a recap of the Blackberry webinar from this series.

The Blackberry webinar featured Richard Balsewich who provides application development guidance and technical architecture expertise for RIM/Blackberry. Here [are the basics Richard gave for developing applications on Blackberry/RIM devices](https://s3.amazonaws.com/digitalgov/_legacy-img/2012/05/mobile-platform-blackberry-slides.pdf) _(PDF, 29 pages &#8211; 3.6 MB)_.

  <strong>How do I start to develop RIM/Blackberry Apps? </strong>
</p>

The main application distribution site is [Blackberry App World](http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/?) which has no registration fees for development. All a developer to has to do to start developing is [register](https://appworld.blackberry.com/isvportal/), access the developer kit and get a sign in key.

**What Development Options Does RIM/Blackberry offer?**

There are 6 different development options (like Adobe Air, HTML 5) you can use to create apps on the Blackberry platform. The proper option for you depends on what type of app and/or device you are developing for (Richard explains all 6 options starting 7 minutes into the webinar). In addition, Blackberry Webworks helps with cross development platform development (explained at 16 minute mark).

**How Do You Get An App in Blackberry App World?**

After you register as a developer and you get your code sign in key, you apply for a vendor portal to deploy your apps. This is where you can get analytics information and will be where you will distribute your apps. Portal approval averages 2-3 days.

**Was There A Live Development Demonstration?** 

Yes, Richard demonstrates development in Blackberry WebWorks at 26 and 36 minutes into the webinar.

  * Tips and tricks for open source development on Blackberry like leveraging Blackberry GitHub Social Coding (35 minutes).
