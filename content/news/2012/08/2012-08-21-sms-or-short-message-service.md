  * Potential users will have different SMS billing plans with their mobile service providers. Some will have unlimited plans and some will be charged by the SMS message. It is important to consider this when designing an agency program. Agencies should explain to potential users how often the program will SMS them and remind them to consider their SMS billing rates.
  * It is important to know that mobile technologies should not be solely relied upon in emergency situations. Coverage may be spotty and/or mobile networks may be overloaded or down (either intentionally or unintentionally) during times of crisis. SMS can provide one means of emergency communication, but certainly not the only means.
