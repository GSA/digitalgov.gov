Yesterday marked three months since the release of the Digital Government Strategy and agencies have been making great strides in meeting the milestones toward building a 21st Century Government. In his blog, [_Building-blocks of a 21st Century Digital Government_](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2012/08/23/building-blocks-21st-century-digital-government), Steve Van Roekel said:

> Executing on this vision of government cannot happen alone. To provide the highest value of services, we must rethink from step one how government builds and provides services for the American people. We must unlock rich government data, information and services so that everyone from citizen developers and private sector entrepreneurs, to our very own Federal agencies can help provide the American people with the access to these services “anywhere, anytime, on any device.”

This blog was released in conjunction with the [milestones deliverables page](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/digitalgov/deliverables) where you can find:

  * [Agency Digital Strategy Pages]({{< ref "2012-08-22-agency-digital-strategy-pages.md" >}} "Agency Digital Strategy Pages")—where agencies will be posting candidate data sets and services that they will mobilize or make available via API.
  * [Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Toolkit](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/digitalgov/bring-your-own-device)—that includes key considerations, best practices, and examples of existing policies from successful BYOD programs launched at forward-leaning agencies.
  * [Governance Recommendations](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/digitalgov/digital-services-governance-recommendations)—guidance for agencies to stand up effective digital services governance structures consistent with Milestone Action #4.2. Read about the [_&#8220;Agile Sprinting&#8221;_]({{< ref "2012-08-12-agile-sprinting-to-digital-governance-recommendations.md" >}} "Agile “Sprinting” to Digital Governance Recommendations") that took place to get there.
  * [Performance Metrics Guidance & Tools]({{< ref "2013-07-15-digital-metrics-for-federal-agencies.md" >}} "Digital Metrics for Federal Agencies")—to enable data-driven decisions on service performance, Milestone Action #8.2.
  * [Report on Mobile Security](http://csrc.nist.gov/) from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) summarizes forthcoming publications on managing and securing mobile devices and information on how NIST’s standards and guidelines should be used in the mobile landscape.

What&#8217;s your agency doing to meet the milestones? Let us know about the great work you are doing, and remember to check out the [Digital Services Innovation Center](http://gsablogs.gsa.gov/dsic/) webpage and digital strategy milestone page for guidance, resources, and training.
