We have been focusing on three areas,

1. **The Digital Analytics Program.** We [announced](http://gsablogs.gsa.gov/dsic/2012/10/05/digital-analytics-program-helps-agencies-measure-web-performance/) this program in early October to help agencies better measure performance and customer satisfaction to improve service delivery. It includes [digital metrics guidance and best practices]({{< ref "/guides/dap/_index.md" >}}"Digital Metrics for Federal Agencies"), [training]({{< ref "/about/digitalgov-university.md" >}} "DigitalGov University") and a federal-wide Web analytics tool and support. We are rolling out the code for the tool to all agencies now. [See more on the Digital Analytics Program]({{< ref "/guides/dap/_index.md" >}} "DAP: Digital Analytics Program") and supercharge your analytics.

2. **Open Content Management**. To support infrastructure and content needs across the federal government, we developed a CMS toolkit with resources to help agencies choose, design and migrate to a content management system (CMS). A CMS not only helps agencies efficiently manage their online content, but also can help them move to an open content model, making it easier for people to find, share, use, and re-use government information.  And, for agencies who need a government policy-compliant platform and hosting solution, we’ve alpha launched [sites.usa.gov, an enterprise-ready CMS service in the cloud](https://sites.usa.gov/). We’re happy to [help you get started](https://sites.usa.gov/).

3. **API Resources**. APIs have been called the “secret sauce” for digital services. They help open information (content and data) so it can be reused inside and outside of government. We’re helping agencies build out APIs by building out knowledge. Agencies can [use the API Toolkit]({{< ref "2013-04-30-apis-in-government.md" >}} "APIs in Government") to learn API basics and see examples of APIs in government. We&#8217;ve also sponsored a six-part (and growing) API webinar series.

But much more important than the parts, is how this is working together to improve the service that government provides. Agencies are working on building out APIs and developer resources, like [Department of Labor](http://developer.dol.gov/) and the [Department of Health and Human Services](http://www.hhs.gov/developer). They are making services available via mobile like solutions being offered by [USDA](http://howtomobile.apps.gov/2012/11/30/usdas-soil-web-app/) and the [Government Printing Office](http://howtomobile.apps.gov/2012/11/15/presidential-documents-mobile-web-app/). And some are doing both at the same time, like [the Census Bureau](http://blogs.census.gov/2012/07/25/pardon-our-dust-census-gov-transformation/) at the Department of Commerce.

Let us know what else you need, and what you have(!) to help build the future of anytime, anywhere and any device government.
