Ensuring Agencies Deliver Integrated Digital Experiences**

OMB recommends that agencies prioritize remediation of websites and digital services based on the following criteria:

1. Public-facing websites and digital services that directly support the delivery of information or a service or benefit to the public, prioritizing those with the highest volume (e.g., transactions, customers served) or those with an outsized impact in the lives of the population served (e.g., services designed for Tribal members to access and manage trust assets).
2. Public-facing websites and digital services with the highest volume (e.g., average monthly unique users, average daily visits).
3. Severity of website or digital service issue (e.g., security or privacy risk, complaints or litigation due to non-accessible design).

OMB recommends that agencies prioritize developing digital options for existing paper forms and non-digital services based on the following criteria:

1. Forms directly supporting the delivery of a service or benefit to the public, starting with those forms associated with the highest volume of annual transactions or highest average adjudication times.
2. Forms directly supporting the delivery of a service or benefit to the public that, if provided digitally, would address user needs, reduce public burden, or improve public impact, as determined based on user research or business analysis.
3. Assistance provided through customer call center support that could be designed as self-service digital tasks for customers to reach resolution on their own.
