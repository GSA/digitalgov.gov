**IV. Ensuring Agencies Deliver Integrated Digital Experiences**

**A. Immediate Agency Actions**

1. **Identify digital experience delivery lead:** Within 30 days of the date of this
   memorandum, agencies shall identify a primary point-of-contact within their organization responsible for communicating information to the relevant stakeholders across the agency, providing requested information to OMB, engaging with other agencies to share best practices for implementation, and overseeing efforts to align with the requirements and recommendations of this memorandum. <sup>83</sup>
2. **Identify public-facing websites:** Within 90 days, agencies shall review data maintained by GSA’s Site Scanning Program <sup>84</sup> and identify public-facing websites to OMB. <sup>85</sup>
3. **Identify and assess top websites:** Within 180 days, agencies shall analyze available web metrics (e.g., through GSA’s Digital Analytics Program) to identify the public-facing websites that generate the top 80 percent of traffic (based on average monthly users) and provide this list to OMB. Agencies should review available automated scanning data (e.g., through GSA’s Site Scanning Program) for these sites to assess conformance and prioritize actions related to the requirements and recommendations of this memorandum.
4. **Assess common questions and top web content for deduplication and SEO:** Within
   180 days, agencies shall identify the most common questions received across all channels (e.g., online search, social media, message boards, chat, email, phone, in person); review available web metrics to identify top pages for common searches; and conduct a highlevel review of potentially duplicative or substantively similar content across websites within the agency or across agencies. Agencies shall provide to OMB a list, in aggregate across channels, of the 25 to 50 most commonly asked questions and a list of no less than 10 opportunities to retire, consolidate, or explain duplicative web content; redesign or rewrite underperforming web content; or further optimize web content to improve search engine results.
5. **Assess top tasks for self-service optimization:** Within 180 days, agencies that provide services to the public shall review the highest volume public-facing services and identify the tasks required to access each service as well as the channels available to complete each task (e.g., online, phone, mail, in person). Agencies shall provide to OMB a list of opportunities for no less than 5 top tasks that can be newly designed or further optimized as self-service digital options.
6. **Inventory public-facing services:** Within 180 days of the release of the Federal Services Index, each agency shall develop and submit a preliminary inventory to the Federal Services Index <sup>86</sup> of all public-facing services. For each service that cannot be made available in a digital format, the agency must provide the information specified by section 4(d) of the 21st Century IDEA. <sup>87</sup> Within one year of the release of the Federal Services Index, agencies shall finalize the inventory and make it publicly available online.
