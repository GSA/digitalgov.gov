title: Why vote.gov supports multiple languages
deck: According to a 2019 U.S. Census Bureau survey, nearly 68 million people in
  the U.S. speak a language other than English at home. To help make the voting
  process accessible to everyone who is eligible, vote.gov works with state
  election offices, federal agencies, and non-partisan organizations to create a
  national source of accurate voting information and clear registration
  instructions in multiple languages.
