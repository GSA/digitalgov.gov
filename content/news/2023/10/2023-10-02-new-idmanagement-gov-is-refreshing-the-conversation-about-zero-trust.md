The General Services Administration Office of Government-wide Policy’s (OGP) Identity Assurance and Trusted Access Division has refreshed [IDManagement.gov](https://www.idmanagement.gov/) that gives government agencies one place to go to learn the latest news in cybersecurity and guidance for implementing [Zero Trust](https://www.idmanagement.gov/zero-trust/). The new design makes information more accessible and learning more enjoyable for everyone.

"Identity management is critical as we look to share more information with trusted individuals,” said Dan Pomeroy, deputy associate administrator for OGP’s Office of Technology Policy. “Our team’s work on IDmanagement.gov provides all of the key resources for federal agencies to apply the best practices for information access."

Zero Trust is an approach to cybersecurity that goes beyond “trust but verify” and treats all networks and correspondence as potential threats. IDManagement.gov can help federal agencies, vendors, acquisition professionals, program managers, and anyone else interested learn how to plan for, implement, and reach Zero Trust more quickly — enabling the right individual to access the right resource at the right time for the right reasons.

Explore the different areas within IDManagement.gov that include:

* Current playbooks 
* Federal, Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) architecture basics
* University section

The site is designed to help both new and seasoned professionals stay current with digital identity and security concepts. There, users can refresh, upskill, or learn about robust identity implementation as part of an agency’s cybersecurity and FICAM practice.

Ken Myers, the director of the Identity Assurance and Trusted Access Division, said he hopes IDManagement.gov will help more agencies reach Zero Trust by the September 2024 deadline set by the Office of Management and Budget’s memo, [M-22-09 Federal Zero Trust Strategy (PDF, 29 pages, 935 KB, January 26, 2022)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf).

"I'm proud of the work our team has done to modernize the website to ensure better user experience, enhance accessibility, and improve continuous learning on digital identity topics,” Myers said. “I can confidently say we are at the forefront of cyber and our digital identity focus areas are helping agencies achieve Zero Trust maturity quickly through identity first approach.”
