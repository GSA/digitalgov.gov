The initial test image setting up `alt text`, `caption`, and `credit`:

{{< img src="very-large-array-nm" >}}

The caption line below the image displays the text in the `caption` field, followed by the text in the `credit` field -- which includes an m-dash with a space before and after it, and the text is italicized.

The image below was created using a stock photo.

{{< img src="dashboard-templates-dmitry-kostrov-istock-getty-images-1145665438-comp" >}}

The `alt text` has the description, as required for accessibility. Caption text [to describe what it is] isn't necessary. 

Only the attribution goes in the `caption` field. If it were in the `credit` field, it would display like this:

The image below is from a collection with specific attribution requirements. 

A short _description_ of it is in the `alt text`, but the _title_ of the artwork and _source_ are required to be in a caption line below the image (entered in the `caption` field). The attribution -- photog name and image ID -- are also required to be visible in a caption line, and is set in the `credit` field.
