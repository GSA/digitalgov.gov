In a previous post, we explored [selecting the right metrics to optimize your intranet's performance](https://digital.gov/2023/06/13/how-to-choose-the-right-metrics-for-your-intranet/). In this post we will explore the next step — defining benchmarks and targets for key performance indicators (KPIs). This sequel blog post is designed to build upon the insights from our initial post and help you craft a comprehensive strategy for intranet optimization.

## Why benchmarks and targets are vital

Benchmarks and targets act as the lighthouses guiding your intranet towards success. They serve as essential reference points, providing a clear picture of your intranet's current state and its desired destination. Without them, it's like setting sail without a map; you might wander aimlessly or miss your intended course.

## ​​Defining benchmarks

Benchmarks represent the current state of your intranet's performance. They offer a snapshot of where you stand at a given point in time. To establish benchmarks, look into historical data and consult industry standards. For example, if your intranet's current engagement rate is 30%, this becomes your initial benchmark.

## Setting targets

While benchmarks offer a snapshot of your intranet's performance, targets provide the direction for improvement. Targets are the destinations you aim to reach on your intranet journey. They are specific, measurable goals that indicate success. These targets should align seamlessly with your intranet's objectives and the metrics you've selected. For example, using our engagement rate example mentioned above, you might set a target to increase it to 50% within the next quarter.

## Benchmarks and targets for intranet performance

To effectively optimize your intranet, you must establish benchmarks and targets that align with your organization's unique goals and circumstances. These benchmarks should encompass a range of critical metrics, similar to the framework we explored in our [previous post](https://digital.gov/2023/06/13/how-to-choose-the-right-metrics-for-your-intranet/). Here's a table that includes 10 benchmark and target examples:

<table class="usa-table usa-table--striped">
  <caption>Bordered table with horizontal stripes</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Benchmark Example</th>

    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><strong>1) 30% engagement rate</strong></th>
      <td>Increase to 50% within the next quarter.</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>Extend to 15 minutes per session within the next quarter.</td>
      <td>Determine the average time users spend on your intranet during a single visit.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><strong>4) 20% bounce rate</strong></th>
      <td>Reduce to 15% within the next quarter.</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><strong>8) 80% course completion rate</strong></th>
      <td>Increase to 90% within the next quarter.</td>
      <td>Measure the percentage of users who successfully complete online training courses.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><strong>9) 60% utilization rate</strong></th>
      <td>Achieve 70% utilization rate within the next quarter.</td>
      <td>Determine the percentage of users who utilize the intranet's search function for information retrieval.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><strong>10) 200 attendees per webinar</strong></th>
      <td>Reach 250 attendees per webinar within the next quarter.</td>
      <td>Keep tabs on the number of users participating in virtual events or webinars.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

Remember, these benchmarks and targets should evolve with your intranet's objectives and user needs. Regular monitoring allows you to make data-driven adjustments, ensuring that your intranet continues to align with your organization's goals.

## Conclusion

Objectives define the broader mission, guiding the intranet's purpose. [Metrics offer continuous insight](https://digital.gov/2013/07/15/digital-metrics-for-federal-agencies/), revealing strengths and areas for improvement. Benchmarks establish the starting point, while targets set the course for progress. Not included in this discussion are the tactics you’ll employ to reach those targets. Having targets will also allow you to measure the success of your tactics. Together, they form an integrated strategy that ensures your intranet not only meets but exceeds expectations. This holistic approach propels your intranet towards its full potential, delivering value to your organization and its users.

As you navigate this journey, remember that intranet optimization is not a destination but an ongoing pursuit of excellence, where the alignment of these elements propels your intranet towards its full potential, delivering value to your organization and its users.
