Our initial test image setting up `alt text`, `caption`, and `credit`:

{{< img src="very-large-array-nm" >}}

The caption area below the image can contain 1) text in the `caption` field, and 2) text in the `credit` field.

If supplied, the `credit` field triggers: 1) the addition of an m-dash with 1 space before and 1 space after it, 2) the copy gets italicized, and 3) it's added to the _end_ of the caption line beneath the image.

The image below was created using a stock photo.

{{< img src="title-card-who-controls-your-control-systems-chor-muang-istock-getty-images-1423481986-comp" >}}

The `alt text` has the description, as required for accessibility. Only the attribution goes in the `caption` line. If the attribution were in the `credit` field, it would look like this:

The image below is to be used in upcoming blog post. The _title_ of artwork and _source_ are required to be in a caption line below the image (entered in the `caption` field), while a short _description_ of it is in the `alt text`. The photog and image ID are also required to be visible below the image in a caption line, and is set in the `credit` field.
