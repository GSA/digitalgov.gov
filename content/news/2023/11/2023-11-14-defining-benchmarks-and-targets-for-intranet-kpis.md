In the img yml code: "credit" text is italicized, and is added to the _end_ of a photo's "caption" line; the two portions are separated by the addition of an _m-dash_, which is triggered when the credit field is filled in. Our initial test image: 

{{< img src="very-large-array-nm" >}}


The image below is to be used in upcoming blog post. The title of artwork and source are required to be below the image (entered in the `caption` field), while a _description_ of it is in the `alt text`. The photog (and image ID), also required to be visible below the image in a caption line, is set in the `credit` field.

{{< img src="screen-at-fda-by-doh-ho-suh-library-of-congress-photo-carol-m-highsmith" >}}


The image below was created using a stock photo.
