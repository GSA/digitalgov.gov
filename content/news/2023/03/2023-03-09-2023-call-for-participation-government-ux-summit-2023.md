Digital.gov’s User Experience (UX) community of practice is excited to announce that we are seeking submissions for presentations at the 2023 UX Summit. The summit will be held virtually on June 14, 2023.

Based on the feedback we received after last year’s summit, we are trying a new, streamlined submission and review process.

## Submissions

The theme of this year’s UX Summit is Driving innovation through inclusion, which aligns with the [President’s Management Agenda](https://www.performance.gov/pma/) (PMA) to deliver results for all Americans. All submissions should have a focus on UX work in the U.S. federal government, or a tie-in to federal UX work. This year’s theme is a point of inspiration, submissions do not have to be directly related to this theme.

The review team will consider submissions that are relevant to UX, address the needs of the UX community of practice, and are of value to everyone. We appreciate considering content that is inclusive of all levels of experience.

Please include all of the following information for your submission to be considered:

* For each speaker:

  * Name
  * government email address
  * position
  * organization
* For submissions with multiple speakers, identify the primary point of contact. ***The primary speaker must be a federal employee.***
* Presentation title
* Abstract (about 300 words) to be published on the Digital.gov event page. Further instructions are provided in the submission form.
* Concise statement describing the value to the UX community of practice
* Key takeaways for a beginner, intermediate practitioner, and seasoned professional
* Choose the best PMA priority in which your submission falls:

  * Strengthening and empowering the federal workforce (PMA priority 1)
  * Delivering excellent, equitable, and secure federal services and customer experience (PMA priority 2)
  * Managing the business of government (PMA priority 3)
  * Help the Federal Government answer critical research questions (learning agenda)
  * Other

Presentation materials must follow all [Community Guidelines](https://digital.gov/communities/manage-your-subscription/), including not naming private companies, brands, programs, or tools, and they must not contain any copyrighted images or materials.

Selected and confirmed presenters must submit their presentation slides in PowerPoint at least two weeks before the summit. Presentation materials used during the summit will be posted to the Digital.gov event page before the summit begins. 

{{< note "action" >}}**Submissions are due by March 23, 2023**
