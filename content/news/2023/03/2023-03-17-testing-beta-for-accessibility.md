title: Testing Beta for Accessibility
deck: The USAGov team strives to ensure all our websites are accessible to as
  many people as possible. This includes those who need the use of specialized
  assistive technologies when browsing the internet. In building beta.USA.gov we
  deliberately validated that it met Section 508 and WCAG 2.0 compliance
  requirements. Our testing approach includes a three step hybrid method that
  may be suitable for other agency use.
