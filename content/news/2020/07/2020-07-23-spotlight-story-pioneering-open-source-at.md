title: "Spotlight Story: Pioneering Open Source at the CFPB"
deck: "**Spotlight Story: Pioneering Open Source at the CFPB**&mdash;Open source software is a fundamental aspect of how the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has served the public in its short history. In April of 2012, nine months after opening its doors, they released their source code policy, based on the work of the Department of Defense, along with their first two open source projects. Just six days later, they accepted their first pull request. Though a minor change, this was the first documented contribution to a federal government open source codebase by a member of the public."
