Pew released a [recent report tracking trends](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/29/technology-device-ownership-2015/) in digital device ownership</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">and found smartphones and tablets have continued to grow in recent years, while other devices have stalled.</p> {{< legacy-img src="2015/03/600-x-400-Mobile-devices-scanrail-iStock-Thinkstock-ThinkstockPhotos-507329083.jpg" alt="Mobile devices" caption="" >}} 

<p>
  The big headlines from the report are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400">
    Cell phones are now in the hands of more than 92% of U.S. adults, although this trend started to flatten over the past 3 years. That elusive final 8% of U.S. adults might take a while to adopt (or die off, as adults over 65 were the smallest percentage of smartphone users at just 30% of that population, while 78% of them have a cell phone of some sort).
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400">
    Smartphones are owned by 68% of the population and that percentage continues to grow at a high rate.
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400">
    Desktop and laptop computer ownership over the past decade has remained pretty flat, with little to no growth.
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400">
    Tablet computers have grown to 45% adoption, although in the past year that growth has slowed substantially. Tablet ownership is greater among those who have high incomes (51% of people with an income of $50,000 &#8211; $74,999 own tablets, and that rate is 67% for people who earn $75,000+) as well as those who have completed higher education (62%).
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400">
    After surging in the 00â€™s, MP3 player growth has gone flat of the past 6 years.
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400">
    While </span><span style="font-weight: 400"><a href="{{< ref "2015-09-01-trends-on-tuesday-mobile-messaging-and-social-app-research-released.md" >}}">games remain wildly popular</a> on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, the home gaming console market and portable gaming market has remained flat or lost a few percentage points of users. </li> 
    
    <li style="font-weight: 400">
      E-book readers, after growing since 2009, hit their peak in 2013 and have since declined.
    </li></ul> 
    
    <p>
      Most of these trends can be attributed to smartphones and tablets becoming more powerful, with more varied and high-quality app experiences, which are able to serve many uses without compromising on quality native device experiences. This affects everything from e-books to MP3 players to gaming consoles. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">With the <a href="{{< ref "2014-11-04-trends-on-tuesday-phablets-to-top-tablets-in-2015.md" >}}">growth of phablets too</a>, smartphones are continuing to grow</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> and are likely cannibalizing some of the potential tablet growth. </p>
