The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) wants YOU to help them build native apps.

NIST launched the [Reference Data Challenge](http://nistdata.devpost.com/) to improve the way the agency shares scientific reference data. They want third party developers from around the country to build native apps that aggregate and improve the usability of free [NIST datasets](http://nistdata.devpost.com/details/data) and resources. They are offering $45,000 in prize money and are taking submissions until the end of September. They already have [70 volunteers signed up](http://nistdata.devpost.com/participants) for this competition.

Agencies have used the open data competition approach in their quest to provide anytime, anywhere government. In 2011, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducted the [Apps for the Environment challenge](http://www.epa.gov/greenapps/challenge.html) and has a [hub for apps created](http://developer.epa.gov/category/apps/) using EPA data.

The U.S. Census Bureau builds [native apps to showcase their data to developers]({{< ref "2013-12-03-census-mobile-app-showcases-local-statistics.md" >}}). <span class="il">Census</span> recently partnered with the White House to create new data-driven apps developed in response to the <a href="https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/city-software-development-kit-sdk-data-solutions-challenge/" target="_blank">National CitySDK Open Data Challenge</a>. They will be talking about the results and lessons learned from the challenge today at 2 pm EST on a DigitalGov University webinar.
