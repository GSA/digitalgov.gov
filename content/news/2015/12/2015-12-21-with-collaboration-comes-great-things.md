We are pleased to announce the beginnings of a new Syndication.Net/Sharepoint module for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Syndication Storefront. The collaborative effort between HHS and National Institutes of Health&#8217;s (NIH), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) teams will eventually enable .NET content management system users to publish content directly in the [HHS digital media syndication storefront](https://digitalmedia.hhs.gov). {{< legacy-img src="2015/12/600-x-413-Electronic-documents-sharing-Pei-ling-Hoo-Hemera-thinkstock-99708065.jpg" alt="Electronic documents sharing" caption="" >}} 

## How did they do it, and whatâ€™s next?

The NIDDK team ported the existing Java/PHP codebase for the Syndication CMS plugin suite to a .NET environment suitable for Microsoft SharePoint. Currently, the teams are working on adding content tagging support to the SharePoint plugin suite. This enhancement will make it easier for users to find content in the digital media storefront. In the coming months, the Syndication .NET/Sharepoint code is expected to be open-sourced and included with the rest of the syndication code at the official [HHS Syndication GitHub Page](https://github.com/HHS/syndication).
