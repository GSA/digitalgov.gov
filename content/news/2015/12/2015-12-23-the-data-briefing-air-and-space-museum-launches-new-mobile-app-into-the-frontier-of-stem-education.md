It is a beautifully-designed app with a great appeal to both young students and adults who are interested in aerospace careers. As a professor, I like the educational focus and how the various quizzes and job descriptions can help excite students about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) topics. The selfie feature is a fun touch and is a good way to publicize the app.

Another great feature of the app is that it helps the Air and Space Museum understand its visitors better. As people interact with the app and with the exhibits in the Museum, the Museum staff can better plan future exhibits and educational programs. The Air and Space Museum was the first of the Smithsonian Museums to release a mobile website and, now, the [first Museum to release a mobile app](http://blog.nasm.si.edu/behind-the-scenes/mobile-missions/).

The Mobile Missions app is a great example other federal agencies can look to, to fulfill <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/education/reform" target="_blank">President Obama’s initiatives on STEM education</a>. For example, the Department of Education could create a mobile app to help potential STEM students find appropriate STEM educational programs and learning resources. The Department of Interior could showcase biological science jobs in the National Park Service. There are many great federal STEM jobs that students also should be made aware of._Each week, [The Data Briefing]({{< ref "/topics/the-data-briefing" >}}) showcases the latest federal data news and trends._
