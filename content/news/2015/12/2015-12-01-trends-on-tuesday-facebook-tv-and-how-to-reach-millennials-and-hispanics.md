How do you capture millennial and Hispanic eyes? Through their hands. (More specifically: their mobile devices, and the social apps within!). {{< legacy-img src="2015/11/600-x-400-Popular-social-media-icons-on-smartphone-device-screen-scyther5-iStock-Editorial-Thinkstock482565588.jpg" alt="Popular social media icons on smartphone device screen" caption="" >}} 

[AdAge](http://adage.com/article/ad-age-research/facebook-top-tv-reaching-millennials-hispanics/300811/) recently analyzed a study from Nielsen’s Homescan panel which found that in a typical month, 12.2% of millennials can only be reached through TV (looking at the top 10 networks only) versus 14.2% who can only be reached on Facebook.

The numbers are similar for U.S. Hispanics: 16.3% can only be reached on TV versus 17.5% who are only on Facebook.

For organizations using both TV and Facebook to reach their audience, the percentages are higher: 69.3% of millennials and 61.2% of Hispanics can be reached by using both platforms. {{< legacy-img src="2015/11/600-x-400-Hand-using-a-remote-control-Creatas-Creatas-Thinkstock-76802022.jpg" alt="Hand using a remote control" caption="" >}} 

Erin Sills, director of global consumer insights for Facebook, highlighted the importance of mobile in relationship to these statistics, saying that:

> &#8220;We need to keep in mind that Facebook is largely a mobile platform, and it&#8217;s not that mobile is coming: Mobile is here.”
