U.S. shoppers are increasingly using their mobile devices to make purchases during the busiest shopping days: Black Friday and Thanksgiving weekend. {{< legacy-img src="2015/12/600-x-450-Smartphone-Shopping-Bags-style-photography-iStock-Thinkstock-529650829.jpg" alt="Three brightly colored mini shopping bags sit on a smart phone" caption="" >}} 

[According to Custora](http://www.digitaltrends.com/android/black-friday-905-million-sales-came-smartphones-tablets-ios-led-way/), online Black Friday sales rose more than 16% compared to last year, and smartphone use rose to more than 36% (up from 30% last year), with iPhones accounting for the lion’s share of purchases: 77.6%, compared to 22.1% for Android.

The Apple iOS purchase dominance was cited by other reports too. [Adobe Marketing Cloud’s report on the holiday weekend](http://venturebeat.com/2015/11/28/adobe-thanksgiving-and-black-friday-online-sales-up-18-ios-numbers-almost-triple-androids/) said, “On Thanksgiving, $639 million in sales came via mobile devices: 71% ($456 million) via iOS and 28% ($180 million) via Android. On Black Friday, $905 million in sales came via mobile devices: 74% ($670 million) via iOS and 25% ($230 million) via Android.”

Data show that the divide between mobile and tablet devices is often split by age. According to [IAB’s Digital Shopping Report](http://www.iab.com/news/critical-differences-in-digital-shopping-habits-between-age-groups-identified-by-iab-report/), Americans 18-34 prefer smartphones for their retail shopping experiences, and ages 35-54 prefer to use tablets. The most popular activities on both mobile and tablet devices are utility-driven:

  * Locating store hours and locations
  * Browsing products and price comparison shopping
  * Reading reviews {{< legacy-img src="2015/12/600-x-412-Paper-shopping-bags-on-computer-tablet-screen-monticelllo-iStock-Thinkstock-471372762.jpg" alt="Paper shopping bags on computer tablet screen" caption="" >}} 

This increase in mobile shopping and purchasing is further evidence that more people are becoming comfortable with [going mobile-first for complex or sensitive data, like making purchases]({{< ref "2015-03-10-trends-on-tuesday-more-time-consuming-complex-tasks-on-mobile-platforms.md" >}}).

Government website audiences are [a little slower than audiences in the mainstream and commercial space]({{< ref "2015-07-14-trends-on-tuesday-adults-use-mobile-devices-most-of-the-time.md" >}}), but [they’re growing in double digit numbers and will soon make the shift]({{< ref "2015-10-21-gov-analytics-breakdown-2-mobile-is-bigger-than-ever.md" >}}), so agencies need to move quickly to modernize their technology and user experiences to be optimized for mobile users.
