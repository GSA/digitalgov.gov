Agencies have used an [open data competition approach]({{< ref "2015-08-13-nist-hosts-reference-data-challenge-to-create-mobile-apps.md" >}}) in their quest to provide [anytime, anywhere government]({{< ref "2015-10-07-is-your-agency-winning-its-mobile-moments.md" >}}). For example, in 2011, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducted the [Apps for the Environment challenge](http://developer.epa.gov/apps-for-the-environment-lessons-learned/) and has a [hub for apps created](http://developer.epa.gov/category/apps/) using EPA data. {{< legacy-img src="2014/09/600-x-400-Businessman-Fighting-Bplanet-iStock-Thinkstock-181596463.jpg" alt="Fighting businessmen" caption="" >}} 

Here’s an update on challenges hosted by other agencies:

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), hosted a nationwide [Reference Data Challenge](http://nistdata.devpost.com/) to create mobile apps through Devpost. The concept behind [this challenge]({{< ref "2015-08-13-nist-hosts-reference-data-challenge-to-create-mobile-apps.md" >}}) was that developers could help scientists and engineers through organizing data.

{{< legacy-img src="2015/12/250-x-444-Meru-Lab-Reference-Element-Info-screen-on-the-Android-app.jpg" alt="Meru Lab Reference's Element Info screen on the Android app." >}}They awarded a total value of $45,000 to three challenge winners.

  * The [ChemBook App](http://devpost.com/software/chembook-5p7kxd) holds details and properties on elements and compounds.
  * The [LabPal App](http://devpost.com/software/labpal) combined four different NIST datasets to assist anyone involved in the fields of chemistry, engineering, or physics.
  * The [Meru Lab Reference App](http://devpost.com/software/meru-lab-reference) allows users to view up-to-date chemical species with the help of near field communication (NFC).

In November, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) announced a new competition, [Addiction Research: There&#8217;s an App for that](https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2015/11/03/2015-27939/national-institutes-of-health-national-institute-on-drug-abuse-nida-announcement-of-requirements-and) to see how mobile apps can affect future addiction studies.

NIDA is requiring all apps be created using [Apple Inc.’s ResearchKit](http://www.apple.com/researchkit/), which is designed specifically for biomedical and health research. For the challenge, NIDA encourages addiction researchers to collaborate with developers and engineers to create a winning research app.

The competition runs until April 29, 2016, and the winning app will be announced in August 2016. Three prizes may be awarded: $50,000 for 1st place; $30,000 for 2nd place; and $20,000 for 3rd place—for a total prize award pool of up to $100,000.
