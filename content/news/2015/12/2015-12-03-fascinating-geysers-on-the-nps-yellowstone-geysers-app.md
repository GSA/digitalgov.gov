Geological phenomena such as steaming mud craters, bubbling mud pools, hot springs and geysers are some of the exhilarating features of a geo-thermal wonderland. Old Faithful in Yellowstone National Park falls into this category.

If you are planning a visit to Yellowstone, you can download the National Park Service (NPS)&#8217;s NPS Yellowstone Geysers free mobile app from [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nps-yellowstone-geysers/id901014175?mt=8) for iOS and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.nps.geysers&hl=en) for Android devices.

The app is simple to use with a straightforward menu structure. You can discover the natural wonder of Old Faithful and five other geysers. On your visit to Yellowstone, use this app to learn when Old Faithful and the other predictable geysers may erupt, including: Grand Geyser, Castle Geyser, Great Fountain Geyser, Daisy Geyser and Riverside Geyser. The predictions do require connectivity to the Internet. You also have additional information on each of the geysers at your fingertips, such as the:

  * Type of geyser,
  * Duration,
  * Height of the eruption and
  * How long the eruptions might last.

The safety tips are extremely handy and worth knowing before you visit the park, and the FAQs (frequently asked questions) are informational.

The photo gallery includes amazing pictures of each geyser. Each eruption is quite different, and the collection of photos is enjoyable.

You can also use this app to browse social media content from the park&#8217;s [Twitter](https://twitter.com/YellowstoneNPS), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/YellowstoneNPS), and [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/yellowstonenps/) sites to learn what is happening in Yellowstone.
