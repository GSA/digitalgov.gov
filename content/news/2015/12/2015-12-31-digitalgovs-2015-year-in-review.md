As we look ahead to 2016, we wanted to take a minute to look at our most popular content in 2015 and reflect on our second year. This was a big year for DigitalGov as we saw our session traffic nearly double and our [weekly and daily email subscribers](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USHOWTO/subscriber/new) increase by 15%. DigitalGov was also named as a [2015 must-read blog](http://www.fedtechmagazine.com/article/2015/12/50-must-read-federal-it-blogs-2015) by FedTech magazine, which is due to the great contributions from our guest authors, representing 42 agencies and departments across the federal government!

Looking over the content we published this year and at the pieces you were most interested in, we were happy to see that your interest spans several areas of the digital space, including: [security]({{< ref "/topics/code" >}}), [user experience]({{< ref "/topics/user-experience" >}}, [accessibility]({{< ref "/topics/accessibility" >}}), [social media]({{< ref "/topics/social-media" >}}) and [Terms of Service]({{< ref "/topics/terms-of-service" >}}), and information about our [services]({{< ref "/services/_index.md" >}}).
