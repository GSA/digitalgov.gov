Thanks to all who have contributed in locating or updating the Directory including SAMSHA, [Broadcasting Board of Governors](http://www.bbg.gov/), [United States Coast Guard](http://www.uscg.mil/), [Occupational Safety and Health Administration](https://www.osha.gov/), and [Small Business Administration](https://www.sba.gov/). We appreciate those agencies who have sent us good feedback on the page and thoughts on how we might tag or add other devices in the future!

For those new to the hunt for #lostapps, the campaign mission is simple—find English/Spanish mobile apps and/or websites not listed on the [USA.gov Mobile Apps Directory](https://www.usa.gov/mobile-apps). The Directory is the authoritative source for federal mobile web products, and federal Agencies that do not have their apps registered here are losing out on valuable promotional opportunites on [USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/mobile-apps) and [DigitalGov]({{< ref "/topics/thursday-mobile-products" >}}).

Here’s how you **JOIN** the Great Federal Mobile Product Hunt:

  * Go to the [Mobile Apps Directory on USA.gov](http://www.usa.gov/mobileapps.shtml) AND [USAGov en Espa&#241;ol](http://www.usa.gov/gobiernousa/conectese-gobierno/apps.moviles.shtml) (_formerly known as GobiernoUSA.gov_) to see if your agency’s products are listed.
  * If they are listed, great! Check for updates/corrections to be added.
  * If not listed, or if there is an update&#8211;email us with the subject line “#LostApps” with the name of the mobile app or website and contact person. We will add the app or website to the registry, and we may profile it in our [Thursday Mobile Products]({{< ref "/topics/thursday-mobile-products" >}}) series here on DigitalGov.

We will be revisiting this campaign at Day 100! We’d greatly appreciate any feedback on the Mobile Apps Directory in the meantime via email. #thehuntison
