A Content Management System (CMS) allows people to easily publish, maintain and update information online. Choosing a CMS (or [deciding whether you need one at all]({{< ref "2013-12-12-9-reasons-your-agency-should-have-a-cms.md" >}})) is one that many agencies have faced. It’s not an easy choice because there are many solutions available to content managers.

As government agencies, the majority of content we deliver is for a large audience, the public. Therefore, your CMS should be a tool that will allow you to quickly and easily share information with the public.

According to the [Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/sc/2015-content-management-trends-2014-12), there are several upcoming CMS trends to be aware of:

  * Content creators will gain more control,
  * [Open-source development](http://opensource.com/business/15/5/open-source-clear-choice-cms-development) use will increase,
  * CMS will become a more integral part of an organization’s content strategy. {{< legacy-img src="2015/07/250-x-250-Process-of-creating-site-Process-coding-and-programming-Design-and-programming-enotmaks-iStock-Thinkstock-464986388.jpg" alt="Graphic illustration of a machine that processes pieces of content and produces a web page." caption="" >}}

A CMS [can also help you mobilize]({{< ref "2014-09-03-mobile-web-templates-how-to-use-open-source-cms-to-implement-responsive-web-design-webinar-recap.md" >}}) a new website out of the box.

Some stats about CMS reveal WordPress has been the leader for some time, commanding over [70% of the market](http://www.fiercecontentmanagement.com/story/report-wordpress-leads-pack-most-used-cms/2015-05-13) because of its ease of use [despite some vulnerabilities](http://www.engadget.com/2015/05/07/wordpress-xss-bug/). But with marketplace changes and current trends in CMS, will things remain the same for WordPress? The next two competitors in the field are Joomla and Drupal. Neither of the top 3 solutions are perfect. They each have [pros and cons](http://websitesetup.org/cms-comparison-wordpress-vs-joomla-drupal/).

Who leads the pack of CMS among agencies? A look at this [list showcasing CMSs used within the government]({{< ref "content-management-systems-used-by-government-agencies.md" >}}) reveals that agencies are using a variety of solutions such as Common Spot, Percussion and in-house developed solutions.

What has your experience been with different CMSs?
