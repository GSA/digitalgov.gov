Whether you want to scale the peaks of Mount Everest, scuba dive in the Great Barrier Reef, ride a camel in the deserts of Mongolia, or shop in Paris—it is time for a travel app.

Gone are the days of just booking cheap flights and accommodations. Now there are travel apps for just about anything—planning, packing, pet care, parking, expense tracking, currency conversion, language translation and even optimal light and dark times to help minimize jet lags.

However, a “Must have” app for a safe, healthy, restful, worry free international vacation is [TravWell](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/apps-about), a very unique mobile app from the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](http://www.cdc.gov/). What with the many travel alerts, raging epidemics and endemic diseases, the only way to travel safe and smart is to use this app.

Have you ever wondered—do I need to take any health precautions before I travel to …? Do I need to pack any medications? Will I be able to buy them during my trip?

Don’t worry. CDC’s TravWell app answers those questions and much more. It is available for both iOS and Android users. It takes less than a minute to download and is very intuitive, and easy to use.

The app guides you to pick your favorite destination and your travel dates to create a trip. You can personalize it with your profile. Voila—now you have customized travelers’ health information for your destination literally at your fingertips.

With just a tap of your finger or a click, you can get CDC recommended vaccines and medicines you would need customized for your particular destination. You just show CDC’s recommended list to your healthcare provider and discuss what is right for you. Planning a trip to South Africa, you’ll see that you need protection against Malaria, Yellow fever and other illnesses.

Enter in your regular medications and it’ll auto magically appear in your customized healthy travel packing checklist of medical supplies that you need to pack for your trip. The app gives you a “to do” list of what you need to do to prepare for travel and during the trip. Use the handy customized “to do” list before and during the trip to have a healthy vacation.

It lets you store travel documents, and keep a record of your medications and immunizations, and set reminders to get vaccine booster doses or take medicines while you’re traveling.

You’re able to access latest CDC issued travel health notices, US State Department alerts, emergency phone numbers, and more anytime and anywhere you roam.

For me, this app has come at the right time as I start to plan my summer vacation. Don’t waste another minute if you’re planning to travel. Download this app right now and have a worry free, happy, healthy vacation. Bon Voyage!
