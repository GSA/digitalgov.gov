[Benedict Evans](http://ben-evans.com/), a leading mobile analyst with the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, published a provocative post last week about [the death of the mobile Internet](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2015/9/1/forget-about-mobile-internet).

He details the history of the mobile Web and posits that the mobile Internet **is** the Internet now. The desktop version of the Internet audience is smaller and declining, so organizations should focus resources on developing the mobile-optimized version first.

Evans explains in the post, “Mobile is not a subset of the Internet anymore, that you use only if you&#8217;re waiting for a coffee or don&#8217;t have a PC in front of you—it&#8217;s becoming the main way people use the Internet. It&#8217;s not mobile that&#8217;s limited to a certain set of locations and use cases—it&#8217;s the PC, that can only do the Web (and yes, legacy desktop apps, if you care, and consumers don&#8217;t) and only be used sitting down. It&#8217;s time to invert that mental model—there is not the &#8216;mobile Internet&#8217; and the Internet. Rather, if anything, it&#8217;s the Internet and the &#8216;desktop Internet.&#8217;”

Evans also predicts that this trend will continue to accelerate as more than 4 billion people on Earth already have a mobile phone and many have Web-enabled smartphones. In the post, Evans compares the trend of double-digit, year-over-year growth for smartphones and tablets with the similar year-over-year decline of laptops and desktops, clearly shown in this chart from 2013-2015: {{< legacy-img src="2015/09/600-x-383-UK-mobile-devices-chart-source-Ofcom.jpg" alt="Chart comparing the trend of double-digit, year-over-year growth for smartphones and tablets with the similar year-over-year decline of laptops and desktops between 2013 and 2015." caption="" >}}
