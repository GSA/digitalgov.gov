A long time ago in a federal agency building far, far away on F Street… the [Great Federal Mobile Product Hunt]({{< ref "2015-05-21-start-sleuthing-with-the-great-federal-mobile-product-hunt.md" >}}) launched at the <a href="https://summit.digitalgov.gov/">DigitalGov Citizen Services Summit</a> in Washington, DC. The campaign goal has not waivered from the initial launch because the [USA.gov Mobile Apps Directory](https://www.usa.gov/mobile-apps) remains incomplete. The Directory is the authoritative source for federal mobile Web products, and federal agencies that do not have their apps registered here are losing out on valuable promotional opportunities on [USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/mobile-apps) and DigitalGov]({{< ref "/topics/thursday-mobile-products" >}}). The hunt for the apps yet to be added to the Directory, henceforth labeled as #lostapps, is alive and well with the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)](http://www.noaa.gov/) taking the lead at Day 100. 

The leadership board was neck and neck at <a href="{{< ref "2015-07-09-day-50-the-great-federal-mobile-product-hunt.md" >}}">Day 50</a>, but NOAA decided to join the #lostapps hunt and drop the mic. NOAA added 30 mobile products to the Directory that included <a href="http://www.education.noaa.gov/mobile/index.php">Ka’ena Point Guide</a>, a clearinghouse for education resources for visitors, recreational enthusiasts, students and local residents. (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kaena-point/id663110768?mt=8">Available on iTunes</a>)

A special thank you is in order for those agencies who have contributed to the updating of the Directory since our Day 50 post, including the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/">National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)</a>, <a href="http://www.va.gov/">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)</a>, <a href="http://www.nih.gov/">National Institutes of Health (NIH)</a>, and <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/">Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)</a>. 

## How to Join: 

We need your help to update your agency’s mobile web products on the Directory. 

1. Start by visiting the <a href="http://www.usa.gov/mobileapps.shtml">Mobile Apps Directory on USA.gov</a> AND <a href="http://www.usa.gov/gobiernousa/conectese-gobierno/apps.moviles.shtml">USAGov en Espa&#241;ol</a> (_formerly known as GobiernoUSA.gov_) to see if your agency’s products are listed. 
2. If they are listed, great! Check for updates/corrections to be added. 
3. If not listed, or if there is an update—<a href="mailto:digitalgov@gsa.gov?subject=&#35;lostapps">email DigitalGov</a> with the subject line “#lostapps” with the name of the mobile app or website and contact person. We will add the app/website to the registry, and we may profile it in our <a href="{{< ref "/topics/thursday-mobile-products" >}}">Thursday Mobile Products</a> series here on DigitalGov.

In the meantime, we’d greatly appreciate any feedback on the Mobile Apps Directory—<a href="mailto:digitalgov@gsa.gov">email DigitalGov</a> and share your thoughts!
