{{< legacy-img src="2015/02/250-x-385-IRS2Go\_phone\_2.jpg" alt="New IRS2Go app design" >}}The digital equivalent of a cool rag and a spoonful of Pepto Bismol, the Internal Revenue Service updated their [IRS2Go app](http://www.irs.gov/uac/IRS2GoApp) to provide multi-symptom relief for tax anxiety this year.

IRS2Go lets taxpayers check on the status of their tax refund and obtain helpful tax information.

If you’re e-filing, you can check your refund status within about 24 hours after the IRS confirms receipt of your tax return. If you’re filing paper tax returns, it takes about four weeks to check your refund status due to longer processing times.

But checking the status of your refund isn’t all this app does.

Need free tax preparation assistance? The IRS Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and the Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) Programs offer free tax help for taxpayers who qualify. Use the app to help you find a VITA or TCE site right near your home, complete with walking or driving directions using your smartphone’s navigation app.

Want helpful tax tips? Sign up through the app by submitting your email address.

Need a direct line to the IRS? Find the specific IRS department to call via the app&#8217;s &#8220;Contact Us&#8221; feature.

Be sure to follow the IRS on Twitter, Tumblr, and YouTube – all in the latest version of IRS2Go.

IRS2Go is available for both [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.irs&referrer=utm_source%3DIRSpup%26utm_medium%3Dlanding-page) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/irs2go/id414113282?mt=8) smartphone and tablets._You can download this and other cool mobile government apps with just a few clicks from our [USA.gov Federal Mobile Apps Directory](http://www.usa.gov/mobileapps.shtml). Federal agencies can get their apps in the directory by [using the Federal Mobile Products Registry]({{< ref "service_us-digital-registry.md" >}})._
