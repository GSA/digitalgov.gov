The federal government has IT challenges, and innovative federal projects are tackling those challenges head-on. As projects gain momentum, outside organizations have taken notice.

Recently, [Data.gov](http://www.data.gov/) and DigitalGov’s [Digital Analytics Program]({{< ref "/guides/dap/_index.md" >}}) (DAP) were recognized by the [American Council for Technology and Industry Advisory Council](https://actiac.org/) (ACT-IAC), among 30 other finalists for the Igniting Innovation Award.

ACT-IAC’s 2015 Igniting Innovation Showcase and Awards recognized tools, solutions, services and programs developed by government and industry leaders. Finalists were selected from a field of more than 100 candidates, including federal projects such as the Transportation Security Administration’s [TSA Pre✓®](http://www.tsa.gov/tsa-precheck) and NASA’s [Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Derived Credentials](https://apps.nasa.gov/blog/october-2014-cima-news-and-metrics). Data.gov and DAP were among the top 30 finalists for this year’s awards.

Data.gov was honored as a resource that increases the public’s ability to easily find, download, and use government datasets, including active hurricanes and tropical storms, per diem rates, and the White House visitor log.

DAP helps agencies access, understand, and use digital analytics data. Currently, 37 agencies use DAP on more than 3,700 federal government websites. DAP-enabled websites receive more than 1.2 billion pageviews per month.

The Top 30 finalists displayed their work during a science fair-style exhibition at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center on February 5th. Finalists received votes via ACT-IAC’s app, and the field was narrowed to 8 finalists.

The top 8 finalists, which included Data.gov, pitched their innovations to the Showcase’s in-person audience, “Shark Tank”-style.

The winner was [NYCStreets Permit Management System](http://www.nycstreets.net/public/permits), created by the New York Department of Transportation (NYCDOT). The system replaced an outdated 30 year old mainframe system and provides more self-service options, better transparency and more accountability to the permitting process. Utilities and contractors can apply for permits 24/7/365 on any device, and approved permits can be printed as a PDF. NYCDOT project managers and other staff can access all permit applications and all approved permits.
