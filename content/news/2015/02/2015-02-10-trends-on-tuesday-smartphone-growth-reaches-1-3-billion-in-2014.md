Smartphone adoption rate continues to rise, but the screen sizes users adopt continue to evolve.

According to preliminary data from the [International Data Corporation (<span class="il">IDC</span>) Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker](http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS25407215), smartphone vendors shipped a total of 375.2 million units during the fourth quarter of 2014. IDC states that this was an increase of more than 25%, compared to the fourth quarter in 2013. For the full year, IDC says the worldwide smartphone market saw a total of 1.3 billion units shipped, up 27.6% from the 1.02 billion units shipped in 2013. {{< legacy-img src="2015/02/250-x-250-Graph-with-smartphone-on-abstract-background-cell-phone-illust-sak111-iStock-Thinkstock-508909423.jpg" alt="Rising graph arrow shown above different sizes of smartphones that are getting progressively larger, on an abstract, multi-colored background." caption="" >}} 

IDC reports that Apple devices saw increased sales partially due to the larger screen sizes made available by the company this year. This demonstrates the popularity of [&#8220;phablets&#8221; over &#8220;traditional&#8221; sized tablets and smartphones]({{< ref "2015-01-06-trends-on-tuesday-phablets-top-tablets-in-post-holiday-activations.md" >}} "Trends on Tuesday: Phablets Top Tablets in Post-Holiday Activations"). Screen sizes are going to continue to evolve and challenge organizations to think about different user stories—[see how the gaming industry might approach it](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/ScottMoakes/20150204/235733/Playing_with_Wearables_A_Journey_in_UltraSmall_Game_Design.php).

For government, the approach is two-tiered. Agencies implementing mobile Web sites like responsive Web design should conduct compatibility testing across multiple device screen sizes—this is available via the [Federal Crowdsource Mobile Testing Program]({{< tmp "events/get-your-mobile-compatibility-testing-here-all-about-the-federal-crowdsource-mobile-testing-program.md" >}} "Get Your Mobile Compatibility Testing Here! All About the Federal CrowdSource Mobile Testing Program"). To prepare for wearables and the Internet of Things, agencies should think about [user stories and open data]({{< ref "2015-01-29-how-government-will-accelerate-anytime-anywhere-services-and-information-in-2015.md" >}} "How Government will Accelerate Anytime, Anywhere Services and Information in 2015").
