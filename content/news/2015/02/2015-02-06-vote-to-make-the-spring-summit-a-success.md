Thanks to your awesome input on the Citizen Services Summit agenda and the rallying of the Summit Sounding Board, we now have [more than 70 ideas and 50 comments](http://crowdhall.com/h/299/) on those ideas.

## Vote early and Vote often!

Now you can help choose programming by [voting and commenting on the ideas](http://crowdhall.com/h/299/) you want to see make it on the agenda. Everyone can vote for the presentation(s) they’d like to see at the Summit, and you can vote for more than one great idea. You can vote anonymously and even if you can’t come—VOTE! We will be developing articles and other programming after the summit based on these ideas.

But there’s more! You can also add a comment to volunteer to present or suggest a speaker, or add information and case studies to any of the ideas.

## What is the Summit Sounding Board? {{< legacy-img src="2014/12/250-x-250-People-Background-VOLODYMYR-GRINKO-iStock-Thinkstock-148460156.jpg" alt="Black background with colorful illustrations of different adult male and female silhouettes with speech bubbles" caption="" >}}

We put together the Summit Sounding Board "Spring 2015 DigitalGov Citizen Services Summit") to help us work on the agenda. The Sounding Board is made up of digital innovators across the federal government who are working to build great digital service delivery to the public. They’ve [added and rallied for ideas](http://crowdhall.com/h/299/) during the submission phase to crowdsource ideas for the agenda. They are being led by our manager of [Mobile Programs]({{< ref "/topics/mobile" >}} "Mobile"), Jacob Parcell and will continue to work with us on developing the agenda.

This is your summit, help us make it awesome!
