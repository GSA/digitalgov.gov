Federal agencies must prepare social media readiness procedures for cyber-vandalism, effectively recover control during an incident, and respond quickly to the public to maintain confidence in digital services.

A new toolkit developed by more than a dozen government managers and representatives from major social media platforms, <a href="{{< ref "readiness-recovery-response-social-media-cyber-vandalism-toolkit.md" >}}" target="_blank">&#8220;Readiness, Recovery Response: Social Media Cyber-Vandalism Toolkit,&#8221;</a> will help agencies evaluate and improve security of their programs to ensure they are better prepared for emerging challenges.

In light of recent social media cyber-vandalism incidents affecting public services, the [SocialGov Community]({{< ref "communities/social-media.md" >}}) &#8212; including almost 900 digital engagement managers from across government &#8212; assembled a working group tasked to compile a best practices resource any agency could customize.

One week later, following the rapid collaborative development process outlined in the [U.S. Public Participation Playbook]({{< ref "2014-12-17-3rd-u-s-public-participation-playbook-draft-released-this-month.md" >}}), the new resource is now available as a “living document” for continuous enhancement and expansion to match evolving technologies. We hope experts both within and outside government will continue to improve and expand upon with more training and resources as they develop.

The federal working group assembled to deliver this collaborative resource includes:

  * Alla Goldman, Information Sharing Environment, Office of the Director of National Intelligence
  * Ashley Wichman, GSA
  * Dan Kenny, GSA Emerging Leader Program
  * Dannielle Blumenthal, National Institute of Standards and Technology
  * David Hamm, State of Minnesota
  * Debra Harris, Defense Finance and Accounting Services
  * Jacob Parcell, GSA
  * Jessica Milcetich, USA.gov
  * Jordan Higgins, Defense Intelligence Agency
  * Jody Bennett, Department of State
  * Justin Herman, GSA
  * Kat Mullins, USAJobs
  * Natasha Lim, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
  * Scott Horvath, U.S. Geological Survey
  * Sherri Sokol, Defense Information Systems Agency
  * Travis Brickey, Tennessee Valley Authority

Representatives from all major social media platforms were also invited to participate, including active participation from teams from Facebook, Hootsuite, LinkedIn and more.
