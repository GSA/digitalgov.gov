Big news in the technology world as Microsoft unveiled <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us" target="_blank">HoloLens and Microsoft’s use of holographic computing in the upcoming Windows 10 release</a>. Holographic computing or augmented reality uses computer-generated images that are overlaid on real world videos. For example, a user can view a car through their smartphone. An app can project information such as make and model, fuel mileage, and other facts onto a real-time view of a particular car. The value of augmented reality apps is that the app can recognize a real world object and provide the user relevant information concerning the object.

Download the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Spacecraft 3D app (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spacecraft-3d/id541089908?mt=8" target="_blank">Apple </a>or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.nasa.jpl.spacecraft3D" target="_blank">Android</a>). After installing the app, you can view a three-dimensional model of the Curiosity Mars rover in stunning detail on your front lawn. During the 2014 Holidays, a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/wp/2014/12/01/postal-service-features-augmented-reality-in-holiday-app-heres-how-it-works/" target="_blank">Postal Service augmented reality app</a> allowed users to view animated messages whenever the user scanned one of the Postal Service’s blue mail boxes. This was a demonstration project to convince marketers that they could also attach augmented reality advertisements to postal products.

Since <a href="http://www.google.com/glass/start/" target="_blank">Google Glass</a> was introduced, federal agencies have thought of many possible applications for holographic computing to improve operations in government agencies and government services to the American public. In 2010, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released an <a href="http://fcw.com/articles/2012/08/15/home-page-management-augmented-reality.aspx?admgarea=TC_GOV20" target="_blank">augmented reality educational kiosk to teach children about pollution</a>. Another suggestion is to use an augmented reality app to <a href="http://www.fedtechmagazine.com/article/2013/10/how-augmented-reality-can-help-federal-agencies" target="_blank">tag a suspicious person digitally</a> as he or she travels through an airport. The digital tag can be shared by Transportation Security Administration security agents as they scan the crowds of travelers.

As holographic computing becomes more easily accessible, federal government APIs will be a valuable source of information to supply the augmented reality apps. The federal government can also be a leader in exploring the frontiers of holographic computing.
