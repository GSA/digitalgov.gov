While examples of government social media content may initially seem like mere fun—the [YouTube video of President Obama on Between Two Ferns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnW3xkHxIEQ) or the Transportation Security Administration’s “good catch” pics of [lipstick stun guns](https://instagram.com/p/0WUAzwl9xT/?taken-by=tsa) and [batarangs](https://instagram.com/p/zTOqVrF9wl/?taken-by=tsa)—the potential of applied social data to build, evaluate and improve diverse citizen services is only increasing.

As we recently discussed on DigitalGov, [social media tools are for more than one-way marketing and communication]({{< ref "2015-04-24-meeting-customer-needs-through-social-media.md" >}}): they provide a connective, responsive capability to public services. We [explored some of the biggest programs in government social media]({{< ref "2014-12-31-big-in-socialgov-in-2014-services-access-and-participation.md" >}}) last year, from 3D printing and drones to disease tracking and the Internet of Things.

The [SocialGov Community of Practice](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitalgov.gov%2Fcommunities%2Fsocial-media%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEftOg4z77TqX4v3lnFo74pXnH_UA), including almost 1,000 federal managers from more than 160 federal programs, has been a leader in driving the adoption of emerging technologies and strategies that target the improvement of three capabilities: how government agencies interact and collaborate with the public, other agencies, and within their own organizations.

For example, in February, the [Public Participation Playbook](https://participation.usa.gov/) was released, providing agencies with a resource they can use to evaluate and build better programs that give a voice to the people they serve. Cyber-security for digital engagement is of increasing importance, so agencies worked together to develop and launch [Readiness, Recovery, Response: Social Media Cyber-Vandalism Toolkit]({{< ref "readiness-recovery-response-social-media-cyber-vandalism-toolkit.md" >}}). Accessibility for people with disabilities is also a critical need, so agencies collaborated on [Improving the Accessibility of Social Media in Government]({{< ref "improving-the-accessibility-of-social-media-in-government.md" >}}).

In June, we’re focusing on the role social media plays in federal agencies. Our theme articles will touch on a variety of topics, including:

  * [How Kids.gov reaches teachers and parents through Pinterest while also promoting other agencies]({{< ref "2015-06-10-how-agencies-pin-down-their-audiences.md" >}})
  * [Tips for interacting with multilingual audiences on social media]({{< ref "2015-06-19-real-internationalization-isnt-just-geographic-its-linguistic.md" >}})
  * [How the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) uses crowdsourcing to gather scientific data via the CrowdMag mobile app]({{< ref "2015-06-18-noaas-crowdmag-app-citizen-science-on-the-go.md" >}})
  * [How the United States Geological Survey (USGS) uses Twitter for earthquake detection]({{< ref "2015-06-26-tweets-earthquakes.md" >}})
  * [An overview of social media webinars and events hosted by DigitalGov University]({{< ref "2015-06-08-socialgov-round-up-2015.md" >}})
