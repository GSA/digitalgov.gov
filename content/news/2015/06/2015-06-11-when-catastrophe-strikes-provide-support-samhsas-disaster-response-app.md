Disasters can strike at anytime, and responders now have another tool in their repertoire to aid survivors. The [Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration](http://www.samhsa.gov/) (SAMHSA) has developed the [Behavioral Health Disaster Response Mobile App](http://www.store.samhsa.gov/apps/disaster/) to assist mental health responders with pre-deployment and on-the ground information and resources.

SAMHSA has placed their key resource materials in this handy to use app so that responders do not need to keep track of multiple pamphlets and fact sheets. With this app you can:

  * {{< legacy-img src="2015/06/250-x-503-SAMHSA-disaster-app-iphone.jpg" alt="250-x-503-SAMHSA-disaster-app-iphone" >}}Be ready: access resources for any type of traumatic event, including tip sheets; guides for responders, teachers, parents, and caregivers; and a directory of behavioral health service providers in the impacted area.
  * Be prepared: rely on and access pre-downloaded resources on your phone in case of limited Internet connectivity in the field.
  * Be confident: review key preparedness materials so you&#8217;re confident that you&#8217;re providing the best support possible.
  * Share resources easily: send information to colleagues and survivors via text message, email, or transfer to a computer for printing.

This app is available for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.hhs.samhsa.app.disaster&WT.ac=LP_20140206_DISASTERAPP_GOOGLEPLAY), [Blackberry](http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/47454887/?lang=en&countrycode=US&WT.ac=LP_20140206_DISASTERAPP_BLACKBERRY) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/samhsa-behavioral-health-disaster/id787518271?mt=8&WT.ac=LP_20140206_DISASTERAPP_ITUNES) devices.

This is not SAMHSA’s first foray into native app development: DigitalGov previously featured the agency’s [KnowBullying]({{< ref "2014-10-09-bullying-help-prevent-and-protect-anytime-anywhere-on-any-device.md" >}}) app which provides strategies and resources to stop bullying._You can download this app and other cool mobile government apps with just a few clicks from our [USA.gov Federal Mobile Apps Director](http://www.usa.gov/mobileapps.shtml)y. Federal agencies can get their apps in the directory by using the [Federal Mobile Products Registry](http://apps.usa.gov/register)._
