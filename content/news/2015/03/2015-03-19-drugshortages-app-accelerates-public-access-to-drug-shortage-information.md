Drugs in short supply can delay or deny needed care for patients. Shortages may also lead health care professionals to rely on alternative drug products, which may be less effective or associated with higher risks than the drug in shortage.

The app uses a searchable database to provide real-time information to key stakeholders, including health care practitioners and pharmacists. It allows users to quickly identify current drug shortages, resolved shortages and discontinuations of drug products.

The app:

  * Helps health care practitioners make quick decisions about patient treatment
  * Allows users to search for a generic name or active ingredient, and browse by alphabetic list or therapeutic category
  * Provides information on how to report a shortage or supply issue
  * Links to other resources from FDA and the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists.

The app is available for free download [via iTunes or the App Store for Apple devices](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=944986401&mt=8) and the [Google Play store for Android devices](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.fda.drugshortages) by searching “FDA Drug Shortages.”
