Data and code are the foundation, building blocks, and cornerstone of government digital services. They are the keys that open the door to a better digital government future and are [fundamental in making government more open](http://www.whitehouse.gov/open). No matter who you are or where you work in the federal space, data and code enable your projects to meet real needs.

This month weâ€™re featuring articles around the theme of data and code. Here&#8217;s a sneak peek of what we have lined up:

  * [A summary of recent programming from DigitalGov University on opening data, code and building APIs]({{< ref "2015-03-11-data-code-and-api-event-round-up.md" >}})
  * [How the U.S., Mexico and Canada are working together to improve digital citizen services via open data]({{< ref "2015-03-13-us-canada-and-mexico-collaborate-to-improve-open-government-and-digital-services.md" >}})
  * [Why (and how) your APIs need design help]({{< ref "2015-03-16-why-your-apis-need-design-help.md" >}})
  * [How the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Cancer Institute got started with open and structured content models]({{< ref "2015-03-20-structured-content-in-government-how-hhs-and-nci-are-getting-started.md" >}})
  * [Lessons learned from two Securities and Exchange Commission projects that use XML for Web metadata publishing]({{< ref "2015-03-23-web-metadata-publishing-using-xml.md" >}})
  * [The most relevant and useful If This Then That recipes for federal digital managers]({{< ref "2015-03-30-on-the-spot-must-have-ifttt-recipes-for-government.md" >}})
  * [Federal employees weigh in on the use of HTTP versus HTTPS]({{< ref "2015-03-25-http-vs-https-is-it-time-for-a-change.md" >}})

And speaking of open, the theme for our Spring 2015 Citizen Services Summit is &#8216;Open&#8217;, and the SocialGov team [opened the U.S. Public Participation Playbook to coders]({{< ref "2015-02-05-u-s-public-participation-playbook-open-for-coders-and-designers-on-github.md" >}}) last month. The Playbook itself is open, with contributions and feedback solicited throughout the development process. Remember that every Wednesday, Bill Brantley from USDA writes the weekly [API Briefing]({{< ref "/topics/wednesday-api-briefing" >}}) where you can learn how government APIs are transforming government and improving services. We also encourage you to learn how you can [get your data on Data.gov]({{< ref "2014-12-10-introducing-get-your-open-data-on-data-gov.md" >}}) and [how their data pipeline works]({{< ref "2014-12-04-data-govs-data-pipeline-explained.md" >}}).
