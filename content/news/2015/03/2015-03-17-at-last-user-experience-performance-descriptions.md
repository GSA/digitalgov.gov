To improve your digital systems with user experience (UX), you need people. And to get people in government, you need position descriptions. While DigitalGov has collected a [wide variety of position descriptions]({{< ref "sample-position-descriptions-for-digital-government-jobs.md" >}}), I thought I would create a post specifically on UX positions, and explain the difference between these jobs. Yes, there is overlap. But this is still an excellent place to get started.

I am indebted to the helpful heroes at **USAJOBS** for scouring through their vast job database to find these examples. And much thanks to our UX interns Stacey Sarris and Joel Virothaisakun for the heavy lifting.

One final thing: this is meant as a starting point to this very wide and varied field. If you have examples to share or comments to improve this resource, [email us](mailto:govux@gsa.gov).

**1. Cognitive Research / Psychology**

The practice of researching people’s behavior and motivations and applying that understanding to user experience.
