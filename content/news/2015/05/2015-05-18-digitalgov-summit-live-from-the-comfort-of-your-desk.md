The DigitalGov platform helps federal agencies meet 21st century digital expectations, and we’ve planned our second [DigitalGov Summit](https://web.archive.org/web/20150623214816/http://summit.digitalgov.gov/) with this mission and your needs in mind. The theme is open and [the agenda](https://web.archive.org/web/20150706193108/https://summit.digitalgov.gov/agenda/) is packed with presentations about how “opening” data, content, contracts and talent makes digital citizen services better, more effective and even cheaper.

## Attending Virtually

For our Summit this Thursday, we have an amazing line up of speakers and [YOU can still sign-up to attend](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2015-spring-citizen-services-summit-registration-12671367401). Over the years, we’ve received lots of feedback about hosting more virtual-live events so that we can include those who aren’t in DC. This year’s livestream will allow digital practitioners from around the country to join the Summit.

Live stream participants will also hear exclusive content:

  * Bernetta Reese, Web and Project Manager for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, will conduct live “red carpet” interviews with [Expo exhibitors](https://web.archive.org/web/20150706193127/https://summit.digitalgov.gov/expo/) and [Summit speakers](https://web.archive.org/web/20150706193121/https://summit.digitalgov.gov/speakers/).
  * Exclusive interviews will be held on: 
      * [Open and Structured Content Modeling]({{< ref "2015-03-20-structured-content-in-government-how-hhs-and-nci-are-getting-started.md" >}} "Structured Content in Government: How HHS and NCI Are Getting Started") at the Department of Health and Human Services with Sally Dadjou, Public Affairs Specialist for HHS.
      * [The Public Participation Playbook](https://participation.usa.gov/) with Justin Herman, Federal-wide Social Media Program Lead at GSA.
