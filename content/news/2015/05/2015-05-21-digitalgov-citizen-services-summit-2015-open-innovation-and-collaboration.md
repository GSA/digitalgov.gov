Digital innovators from across government were asked to think of technology as digital service for their country at today&#8217;s [DigitalGov Citizen Services Summit](https://summit.digitalgov.gov/).

The theme of this year&#8217;s Summit was "open." The agenda was packed with presentations about how "opening" data, content, contracts, and talent makes digital citizen services better, more effective or even cheaper. A diverse array of topics were addressed, including privacy and identity management, 3D printing, and agile methodology.

Megan Smith, U.S. Chief Technology Officer, opened the Summit, challenging all techies in government to help solve problems and be part of decision-making at the highest levels of government.

She also said that young people have found ways to serve their country through the Peace Corps and Teach for America and invited the group to think how they could serve digitally.
