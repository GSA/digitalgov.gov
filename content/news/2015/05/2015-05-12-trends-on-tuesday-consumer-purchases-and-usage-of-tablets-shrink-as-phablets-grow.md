[Consumers are buying less tablets and more phablets](http://recode.net/2015/05/06/the-tablet-story-isnt-over-but-its-changing/), especially in the U.S.

Three recent research reports released in the past week from [IDC](http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS25593415), [Flurry](http://flurrymobile.tumblr.com/post/117769261810/the-phablet-revolution) and [Kantar](http://www.kantarworldpanel.com/global/News/US-phablet-market-soars) each point to a shift in consumer purchasing habits over the past quarter, showing that consumers are reducing the number of tablet devices purchased with an increase in “phablet” or large 5-inch sized phones increasing.

“Phablets claimed 21% of all U.S. smartphone sales in Q1 2015 – nearly quadrupling their 6% share from the first quarter of 2014,” [Katar WorldPanel’s report cites](http://www.kantarworldpanel.com/global/News/US-phablet-market-soars). “Apple iPhone 6 Plus took 44% of this segment. Screen size was cited as the main reason for buying a particular phone by both iOS and Android buyers at 43% and 47%, respectively.”

Flurry, a mobile analytics company owned by Yahoo!, was shocked by the results. On their mobile insights blog they wrote, “The growth in phablets from only [a year ago](http://www.flurry.com/blog/flurry-insights/tides-turn-phablet%E2%80%99s-popularity#.VTxNHhOUc7M) is staggering: In January 2014, phablets accounted for only 6 percent of the used devices. In March 2015, the phablet share more than tripled to 20 percent! This growth has come mostly at the expense of medium-sized phones, which lost 9 percent share in the past year. Full-size tablets and small phones also suffered losses in share while small tablets held their ground at 7 percent.”

This [phablet consumer trend exploded in Asia over the past couple years](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/02/phablets-asia-pacific-tablets-laptops-growth) and has slowly made it’s way over to the U.S. with the tipping point coming this past year&#8217;s release of the Apple iPhone 6 Plus. For many years, Apple resisted large phones ([Steve Jobs famously and frequently criticized big phones](http://www.engadget.com/2010/07/16/jobs-no-ones-going-to-buy-a-big-phone/)) and Android built a strong base of users who wanted the larger devices:

While phablet purchases have been growing, [IDC’s report says that tablet growth continues to shrink](http://flurrymobile.tumblr.com/post/117769261810/the-phablet-revolution), impacted by phablets eating their share of the market:

&#8220;The market slowdown that we witnessed last quarter is continuing to impact the tablet segment, but we see some growth areas that are starting to materialize,&#8221; said Jean Philippe Bouchard, a research expert on tablets at International Data Corporation. &#8220;Cellular-enabled tablets are outgrowing the rest of the market, providing an additional revenue stream for OEMs and mobile operators. In addition to driving higher usage than Wi-Fi-only tablets, cellular-enabled tablets also help position the segment as true mobile solutions rather than stay-at-home devices.&#8221;

For government agencies, this continues to echo the drum beat that [we need to move swiftly to mobile-friendly sites]({{< ref "2015-05-05-trends-on-tuesday-u-s-mobile-only-internet-users-now-outnumber-desktop-only-users.md" >}}) that [offer flexible designs]({{< ref "2015-03-31-trends-on-tuesday-smartphone-market-growth-makes-mobile-friendly-a-must.md" >}}) from [small phones to all sizes of tablets and phablets]({{< ref "2015-01-13-trends-on-tuesday-responsive-web-design-implementation-happening-piecemeal.md" >}}) to [serve our constituents]({{< ref "2015-04-07-trends-on-tuesday-40-of-americans-use-smartphones-to-find-government-information.md" >}}).
