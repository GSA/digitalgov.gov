These searches are often driven by [‘need-to-know’ information]({{< ref "2015-04-07-trends-on-tuesday-40-of-americans-use-smartphones-to-find-government-information.md" >}}) or utility-based actions (rather than entertainment or more passive consumption), which aligns with a lot of the information and resources government agencies provide on their digital properties.

Jerry Dischler from Google cited in the announcement, “consumers, particularly on mobile devices, now have higher expectations than ever before—they want everything right, and they want everything right away. This requires that marketers answer their needs in the moment, whenever and wherever they are. Our investments in mobile are driven by consumers’ expectations for immediacy and relevance in the moment.”

Flurry [released research earlier this year]({{< ref "2015-03-10-trends-on-tuesday-more-time-consuming-complex-tasks-on-mobile-platforms.md" >}}) that pointed to similar audience expectations on being able to do [more complex tasks, faster and easier on mobile devices]({{< ref "2015-03-10-trends-on-tuesday-more-time-consuming-complex-tasks-on-mobile-platforms.md" >}} "Trends on Tuesday: More Time-Consuming, Complex Tasks on Mobile Platforms").

More searches taking place on mobile than desktop isn’t surprising as the industry continues to shift to be more [mobile first]({{< ref "/topics/mobile-first" >}}); earlier this year Google shifted search results to give higher rank to mobile-optimized sites, billed by many as the “[Mobilegeddon]({{< ref "2015-04-15-mobilegeddon-government-edition.md" >}}).” Microsoft’s Bing search engine [announced this week that they are also going to make similar changes](http://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/2015/05/14/our-approach-to-mobile-friendly-search/) to elevate mobile-friendly sites in their search results.
