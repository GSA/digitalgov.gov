You can find cute kitten photos online, but you can't find Ben Franklin's jetpack (well, you can search for it, but you won't find it!).

For government agencies, connecting users to information is a critical part of meeting the public's needs and delivering excellent customer service. [DigitalGov Search](http://search.digitalgov.gov/) helps agencies deliver information to government searchers on every level—federal, state, local, and tribal.
