You can find cute kitten photos online, but you can&#8217;t find Ben Franklin&#8217;s jetpack (well, you can search for it, but you won&#8217;t find it!).

For government agencies, connecting users to information is a critical part of meeting the public&#8217;s needs and delivering excellent customer service. [DigitalGov Search](http://search.digitalgov.gov/) helps agencies deliver information to government searchers on every level—federal, state, local, and tribal.

Recently, search analyst Dawn McCleskey sat down to discuss the work of DigitalGov Search, including:

  * What DigitalGov Search does
  * How working with search is a natural fit for librarians
  * Why the government needs a homegrown search service
  * The challenges of managing a search service for 2,500 websites
  * Future directions for DigitalGov Search
  * Why you can&#8217;t find everything online (like searching for Ben Franklin&#8217;s jet pack!)<audio class="wp-audio-shortcode" id="audio-324682-5" preload="none" style="width: 100%;" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/digitalgov/_legacy-img/2015/10/Podcast-Digitalgov\_Search.mp3?\_=5" />
