<a href="http://qz.com/508997/you-really-only-use-three-apps-on-your-phone/">Quartz succinctly summarized the report</a> with the headline: “You really only use three apps on your phone.” The report clearly pointed out that Americans spend 50% of their time in their most-used app, and 78% in their top three favorite apps.
  
Other notable data points:
  
* From June 2013 until June 2015, the time spent on mobile overall jumped 11%; the time spent on mobile apps jumped 12%; and the time spent on desktop devices dropped 11%.
* During the same time period, total digital media usage grew 49%, with app usage growing 90% in the past two years.
* On mobile devices, people spend 87% of their time in apps versus 13% in browsers.
* Despite users spending more time in apps, the mobile Web has the largest audience, with 433 million unique visitors vs. 123 million.
* Social media and entertainment apps account for the six top app categories and drive two-thirds of total time spent on apps. Even more astounding: The average mobile user spends a whopping 26 hours per month on social apps, and that average is 16% higher among millennials!
  
It is crucial for government agencies to consider this data in digital product decision making, especially when analyzing app usage numbers and your potential audience. Are their <a href="{{< ref "2015-06-01-finding-the-best-mobile-moment-is-the-first-stepping-stone-to-anytime-anywhere-government.md" >}}">mobile moments</a> going to be social or entertainment driven ones? If so, then consider an app approach, but otherwise it might be a difficult process to get users to regularly engage with your digital experience.
