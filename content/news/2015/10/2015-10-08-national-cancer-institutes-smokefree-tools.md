Went a little too far with a bad habit? Do you or someone you love have difficulty putting down the cancer sticks? The [National Cancer Institute](http://www.cancer.gov/) has developed a triple threat to help kick this issue for good with an app, responsively-designed website and SMS program to help lead the way to a healthier life!

{{< legacy-img src="2015/10/250-x-444-quitSTART-iPhone-app-My-Profile-screen.jpg" alt="The quitSTART iPhone app My Profile screen" >}}The [quitSTART app](http://smokefree.gov/apps-quitstart) is free and available to everyone, though tailored to teens. After giving your smoking history, the app will develop a plan for you to quit. There is information about the effects of smoking and secondhand smoke, tips on getting active, eating healthier, and resources on mood management like coping with stress and a self-assessment for depression.

To keep you feeling proud of your growth, there are opportunities for you to have your progress monitored and earn badges to demonstrate your achievement. If you’re experiencing a craving, quitSTART has distractions available through games and challenges to lead your mind away. If you slip up, quitSTART can get you back on track. When you come across a favorite tip or inspiration, it can be personally stored in the app’s Quitkit so you can visit it again.

As you progress away from this bad habit, share your progress via on social media such as Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter! So go ahead and visit the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quitstart/id494552000?mt=8) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mmgct.quitstart) before you have the chance to light up again.

Haven’t downloaded the quitStart app yet? [Smokefree.gov](http://smokefree.gov/), a responsively-designed website, has been tailored to specific audiences: [smokefreeVET](http://smokefree.gov/veterans), [smokefreeespañol](http://espanol.smokefree.gov/), and [smokefreewomen](http://women.smokefree.gov/), and carries much of the same information as that offered by quitSTART.

SmokefreeTXT is available 24/7 for those 13 years and older with a quick signup online or by phone. To sign up on your phone, just text QUIT to 47848. SmokefreeTXT is a 6-8 week program and users will receive 1 to 5 messages each day. You can stop or start again as necessary. At the end of the program, smokefreeTXT will continue to follow up with messages at 1, 3, and 6 months to ensure you’re still on track to smoke-free living. For more information see [DigitalGov’s article about NCI’s SMS here]({{< ref "2015-04-16-nci-reaching-the-public-via-sms-to-change-behaviors.md" >}}).

All of these helpful services are free to use, so go ahead and get on your phone, tablet, or desktop. If you want something simple then stick with the smokefreeTXT and if you want something a little more fun and interactive then go for the app!
