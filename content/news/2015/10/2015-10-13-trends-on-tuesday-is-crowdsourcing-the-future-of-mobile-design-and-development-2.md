NASA recently announced the winners of a [smartwatch app interface competition](http://fedscoop.com/nasa-names-winner-in-smartwatch-app-design-contest). A Canadian duo won the design competition, and NASA’s plan is to build the app with 2016 funding to have it [available for astronauts to use](https://www.freelancer.com/contest/NASA-Challenge-Astronaut-Smartwatch-App-Interface-Design-261634.html) when they are aboard the International Space Station.

This is the first government smartwatch app development we’ve talked about on DigitalGov and an example of a great [mobile moment]({{< ref "2015-10-07-is-your-agency-winning-its-mobile-moments.md" >}}) use case. Not only is the smart app interesting ([see the UI images](https://www.freelancer.com/contest/NASA-Challenge-Astronaut-Smartwatch-App-Interface-Design-261634-byentry-6597765.html)!) but also _how_ NASA is approaching its development is worth examining. While agencies are [crowdsourcing via native apps]({{< ref "2014-12-22-how-six-agencies-are-crowdsourcing-with-mobile-apps.md" >}}) and [crowdsourcing their actual mobile development]({{< ref "2015-08-13-nist-hosts-reference-data-challenge-to-create-mobile-apps.md" >}}), none have publicly crowdsourced just the app design.

While development of native apps requires [easily consumable data]({{< ref "2015-09-30-the-data-briefing-connecting-the-data-dots-nasas-nyspacetag-app.md" >}}), crowdsourcing design requires a little less lift for the agency—essentially, they just need a use case and some requirements for the watch. As we move into the [A-B-C’s of the Internet of Things]({{< ref "/topics/internet-of-things" >}}), new approaches to anywhere, anytime development like this are going to be imperative._Looking for ideas on how to craft a successful crowdsourcing project? The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Federal Community of Practice on Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science [recently released a Citizen Science and Crowdsourcing Toolkit]({{< ref "2015-09-30-how-ostp-crowdsourced-a-crowdsourcing-toolkit.md" >}}) to help agencies open up innovation in government. The toolkit contains information, resources, and best practices federal agencies can use to harness the power of public participation._
