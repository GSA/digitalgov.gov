It can be easy to forget that [customer experience]({{< ref "/topics/cx" >}}) (CX) improvement efforts within the government sphere aren’t limited to surveys, journey maps, [analytics]({{< ref "2014-06-16-government-cx-where-do-you-find-the-right-foundational-metrics.md" >}}), big data, apps, and technology. Watching Export-Import Bank’s Annual Conference come together, I’m reminded of the fundamental role that interpersonal communication plays in improving customer experience, from the front line of our unique agency. The [conference](http://www.exim.gov/newsandevents/events/annualconference/2015/) is happening April 23rd-24th at the Omni Shoreham Hotel in Washington, D.C. and will bring together more than 1,200 U.S. exporters, brokers, bankers, buyers from foreign countries, and government officials, including Ex-Im Bank staff, who will work together to discover more ways to expand exports and create American jobs.

Here’s how the conference shines a light on the fundamental communication aspects of CX.

## Strengthening Relationships

Trade is still very much grounded in relationship-oriented, human interactions. Through networking, the conference gives Bank staff the opportunity to listen to and better understand the business challenges of conference participants. When we understand those nuanced challenges, we can better advise customers on Bank programs and introduce the right subject matter experts to help get deals going.

## Heightening Customer Sophistication

Ex-Im Bank wants to improve the ease of doing business for customers. Getting there means communicating rules, policies, and application-oriented procedures that can impact the speed of completing transactions. When we provide information via breakout sessions or a display on the exhibit hall floor, we’re helping customers understand what to expect and avoid unwelcome surprises during complex transactions.

## Navigating Business Processes

Approximately 95% of the world&#8217;s potential customers live outside of the U.S. We want to empower U.S. businesses to reach those customers while mitigating their export risks. Interpersonal interactions among Bank staff and customers help us to see our business processes through customers&#8217; eyes. From there, we can better equip them to navigate those processes, even as we work on internal improvements that help customers close transactions quickly.

[Ex-Im Bank&#8217;s focus is on customers]({{< ref "2014-02-21-customer-experience-video-blog-stephanie-thum-export-import-bank.md" >}}). We can&#8217;t fulfill our mission if we&#8217;re not providing them with an effective experience of our agency, from start to finish. The Annual Conference is just one more tool in our toolbox for creating an experience that helps customers export to global markets and create more jobs at home.
