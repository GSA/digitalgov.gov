## Categorizing and Describing Cybersecurity Work for the Nation

The [National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education](https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice) (NICE) is pleased to announce the release of Special Publication 800-181, the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework. This publication serves as a fundamental reference to support a workforce capable of meeting an organization’s cybersecurity needs. It provides organizations with a common, consistent lexicon that categorizes and describes cybersecurity work by Category, Specialty Area, and Work Role. It is a resource from which organizations or sectors can develop additional publications or tools that meet their needs to define or provide guidance on different aspects of workforce development, planning, training, and education.

### New Data Available on Cybersecurity Jobs Heat Map!

One example of how the NICE Framework can be used to help move us as a community towards a more standardized approach and common taxonomy for describing cybersecurity careers, can be seen through the CyberSeek portal. CyberSeek, a portal that contains both a heat map and career pathway tool, has just been updated with new data to reflect the current cybersecurity workforce landscape. Check it out at [cyberseek.org](http://www.cyberseek.org/)!
