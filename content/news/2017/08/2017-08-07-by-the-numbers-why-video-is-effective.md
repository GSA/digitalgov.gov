  Here are a few things our HIV colleagues had to say about using videos in their work.
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  Sarah Hashmall, Communications Manager at AIDS United, told us: “Videos are a great way to make content more accessible and inviting to a wider audience. Videos help people feel part of something bigger – and better convey emotion than text. We use video whenever we can get it. We frequently share videos from the CDC’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/actagainstaids/">Act Against AIDS</a> campaigns. They do a great job jump starting conversations on Facebook and Twitter and convey great information – a total win/win for us.”
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  William J. Nazareth, Jr, Director of Creative Media, Callen-Lorde Community Health Center, said “As an LGBTQ focused community health center, Callen-Lorde understands that our communities access information in varying ways. With the growth of new media, it is vital that we meet people where they are in order to communicate in the most effective ways possible. Without video as a medium we could not spread information on important topics like pronouns and PrEP on platforms like Facebook and YouTube.”
