After recently celebrating our [Fifth Birthday and logo update]({{< ref "2017-06-13-fedramp-5th-anniversary.md" >}}), the FedRAMP PMO is excited to announce a few more changes to our website in the form of a new blog series and newly created [Tips & Cues page](https://www.fedramp.gov/?p=66820).

In the interest of communicating information about how to best work with FedRAMP regularly, we will be introducing a series of multi-part blogs. These series will be published weekly, in addition to any programmatic updates that occur. Our series of blogs will cover the following topics:

<li class="first-child">
  Understanding FedRAMP
</li>
  * Understanding the Readiness Assessment Report (RAR)
  * Tips for working towards an Agency ATO and becoming In Process with an Agency
<li class="last-child">
  Acquisitions
</li>

Additionally, we’re excited to show off our newly created [FedRAMP Tips & Cues](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/fedramp-tips-cues/) page. Rather than publishing the Tips & Cues within the Focus on FedRAMP Blog each week, we’ve moved all of the FedRAMP Tips & Cues to this new page. With the Tips & Cues now in one location, they will be more accessible and easier for our stakeholders to search.

If you have ideas about topics for the [Focus on FedRAMP Blog](https://www.fedramp.gov/focus-on-fedramp/) or [Tips & Cues](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/fedramp-tips-cues/) that it would be helpful for us to cover, please [email us](mailto:info@fedramp.gov).
