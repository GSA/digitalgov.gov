title: "DigitalGov Year in Review: Our Top Blogs, Resources, and Writers for 2016"
summary: DigitalGov had a pretty great year in 2016, and that was largely due to a bevy of talented and dedicated writers from over 50 agencies and departments across all 3 branches of the federal government (Thank you!!!). Below, we’ll review some program highlights from the last year, including our top-viewed articles and resources, and tell you how you, too, can contribute to DigitalGov in 2017.

For most of us Gen X and Gen Y kids, 2016 was not kind to our childhood. The biggest blows for me were losing two music icons and Internet innovators, David Bowie and Prince <sup><a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#fn1" id="footnotes-ref1">[1]</a></sup>, and everybody’s favorite space princess, Carrie Fisher. But, work-wise, I’m pleased to say that DigitalGov had a pretty great year, and that was largely due to a bevy of talented and dedicated writers from more than 50 agencies and departments across all three branches of the federal government (***Thank you!!!***). Below, we’ll review some program highlights from the last year, including our top-viewed articles and resources, and tell you how you, too, can contribute to DigitalGov in 2017.

## Highlights

Great things that happened in the DigitalGov world in 2016 included product and program announcements from some of the teams that we support here at the General Services Administration (GSA) — and there were a couple of really nice “shout-outs.”

Our readers got to learn about the creation of:

* the [U.S. Digital Registry](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2016/02/03/new-u-s-digital-registry-authenticates-official-public-service-accounts/),

In June, the White House released a report that cited Data.gov, Challenge.gov, and CitizenScience.gov among 100 top open innovation efforts in the federal government over the past 8 years — [all 3 appear in the top 15](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2016/06/24/white-house-challenges-citizen-science-among-top-innovation-efforts-of-past-8-years/). In December, DigitalGov was included in FedTech Magazine’s annual list of [50 Must-Read Federal IT Blogs](http://www.fedtechmagazine.com/article/2016/12/50-must-read-federal-it-blogs-2016) for the 2nd year in a row.

## DigitalGov University

This month, we also published [DGU’s Training Trends for 2016](https://medium.com/@DigitalGov/digitalgov-university-in-review-2016-training-trends-ad54dcfc2a3). Check that out, too, to see what type of events had the most attendees, access webinar recaps in case you missed any, and learn how federal employees can contact the DGU team with event suggestions and/or to request information about creating an online or in-person DGU event.

## The Road Ahead

Recently, a new group of writers have signed up to contribute articles for UX, content, DGU webinar recaps, and social media for DigitalGov via the [Open Opportunities program](https://www.digitalgov.gov/join-digitalgov/open-opportunities-in-digitalgov/). In 2017, we expect to share tech-related government news and digital trends, agencies’ success stories, best practices, and case studies; continue to create and update [resources and guidelines](https://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/) for you; and whatever else 2017 brings to keep you informed on the work being done by those in government’s digital realm to serve the American public.
