At the beginning of 2017, the ITIF (Information Technology and Innovation Foundation) released [a report](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2017/03/24/new-itif-report-inspires-a-closer-look-at-website-performance-and-security-here-is-where-to-begin/) that benchmarked 300 federal websites in four areas: page-load speed, mobile friendliness, security and accessibility. Some sites fared better than others, but the report highlighted that our federal sites have a ways to go (DigitalGov included) in these areas.

Looking at these four metrics is important as they directly impact our customers’ first perceptions of the quality of our government’s digital services.

Since it’s been nearly six months since the report was released, we wanted to check in with ITIF and see what they’ve learned, what they’ve heard from agencies and what their future plans are to build on this research. ITIF will also discuss their report and methodology behind it.
