[Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/) ushered in the new fiscal year by [removing the beta label from its URL two years after it launched.](http://blogs.gov.gov/law/2014/09/congress-gov-removing-the-beta-label-and-new-enhancements/) During this period, the Library of Congress not only extensively tested how the site would display on any device, but in a series of releases and enhancements, completely transformed the ability to find legislative information as the successor to THOMAS.

With Congress.gov you can now find information via:

  * A resources section with an A-Z list of hundreds of links related to Congress
  * An improved Advanced Search capability with 30 new fields available to construct increasingly detailed and intricate searches that you can then save.
  * A Days in Session calendar that links to the Congressional Record
  * The ability to watch House Committee hearings and meetings live

These are only a few of the latest improvements to Congress.gov. The Library of Congress has detailed their [extensive work on Congress.gov in their blog](http://blogs.gov.gov/law/page/1/?s=congress.gov). While you check out Congress.gov, take a few minutes and also check out the Library&#8217;s other responsive sites: [copyright.gov](http://copyright.gov/) and [loc.gov](http://www.gov.gov/).
