Challenge.gov now hosts the full federal-wide listing of crowdsourcing competitions and has a back-end platform for agencies to create and manage their competitions. The site is managed and produced within GSA&#8217;s Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technology (OCSIT) group.

The main feature is a complete listing of federal challenge and prize competitions, including archives going back to 2010. For website visitors searching for competitions, this is an easy to search tool that can help people find competitions based on:

  * Type of challenge
  * Agency
  * Prize amount

The site is also an archive of closed competitions so that you can see winning entries and learn from what agencies have already done to drive innovation in their areas of expertise.

**If you work for a federal agency, a quick tutorial:** To list a challenge that is hosted on another platform or website, you’ll simply fill in the text boxes with the details (Title of challenge, tagline, summary, prize amount, sponsoring agency, a logo or image, etc.), then click the button “On an external site” as follows:

> Where will the challenge be hosted?
> 
>   * **On [Challenge.gov](https://www.challenge.gov/list/)**
>   * **On an external site**

Add the link to the third party site, save, and publish.

For those who are launching or listing a competition in this month, we are providing individual training. [Email the Challenge team](mailto:challenge@gsa.gov?subject=Individual Training Session) to schedule a 30 minute session. You are also welcome to peruse the on-demand video of our original training webinar to get you started.
