We are all collecting a lot of performance data across our digital properties and DigitalGov University has hosted many events on the **collection**, **reporting** and **strategizing** around metrics. DigitalGov has shared many posts on these topics as well. So we thought it would be great to curate these events and posts for easy reference and sharing.

## Data Collection

If you are having a hard time measuring the success of your **social media** efforts, **email campaigns** or even your **website**, these are some of the events that’ll help.

[From Gathering to Analyzing Metrics](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYi9OjWUR6E&list=PLd9b-GuOJ3nFwlyvLFUtmDpYFKezhot8P&index=7), with Sarah Kaczmarek, from the **Government Accountability Office** (GAO), focuses on the gamut of gathering to reporting on data.

The social media performance metrics are summarized in this post, [Social Media Metrics for Federal Agencies]({{< ref "2013-04-19-social-media-metrics-for-federal-agencies.md" >}} "Social Media Metrics for Federal Agencies").

We&#8217;ve also hosted a social media performance metrics series put together by Justin Herman, of the General Services Administration (GSA). Each of these events focuses on a performance metric developed by the Social Media Community of Practice:

  * [Social Media Performance Metrics: What You Need to Know](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHj2fWXwrvw)
  * [Social Media Performance Metrics: Measuring Breadth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4_ArLjpT-Q)
  * [Social Media Performance Metrics: Measuring Depth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Edm2TeOXj0w)
  * [How We Measure Direct Engagement](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uWCR85CmBI)
  * [Measuring SocialGov Performance: A CDC Case Study](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vg5fkY24Fk)

Also take a look at the [Turning Data into Action]({{< ref "2014-06-03-digitalgov-summit-panels-recap.md" >}} "Turning Data Into Action—DigitalGov Summit Recap") panel recap from the Spring Digital Citizen Services Summit.

Are you looking for the one pivotal metric? Marina Fox, program manager for the Digital Analytics Program, discusses what it is and if it really exists in [The Golden Metric]({{< ref "2014-06-19-the-golden-metric.md" >}} "The Golden Metric").

## Reporting

These great events on turning data into meaningful reports hosted by Sarah Kaczmarek, of GAO, showcase how to give meaning to data to make it relevant to senior level staff:

  * [How to Create an Annual Metrics Report](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9-aF46xqE4&index=8&list=PLd9b-GuOJ3nFwlyvLFUtmDpYFKezhot8P)
  * [Above and Beyond Metrics: Tell a Story with Reports](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYxi9KvYMok&index=6&list=PLd9b-GuOJ3nFwlyvLFUtmDpYFKezhot8P)
  * [How to Create a Social Media Metrics Report](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqgKTgvARfM&index=3&list=PLd9b-GuOJ3nFwlyvLFUtmDpYFKezhot8P) {{< legacy-img src="2014/10/600-x-400-Graphic-charts-bizoo_n-iStock-Thinkstock-478288259.jpg" alt="Various analytics graphic charts" caption="" >}} 

If you are an agency currently using Google Analytics as your data gathering tool, Sarah has also developed a [Google Analytics for Government Training Manual]({{< ref "2014-05-15-new-google-analytics-for-government-training-manual.md" >}} "New Google Analytics for Government Training Manual").

## Strategizing

Do you have a strategy for not only collecting the data, but then making informed decisions on it? In this recent event, [Optimizing Your Public Sector Web Analytics](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_tkV8A8Co4&list=PLd9b-GuOJ3nFwlyvLFUtmDpYFKezhot8P&index=1), Sam Bronson, from the **Environmental Protection Agency** (EPA), discusses analysis techniques designed to serve a variety of government customer-types and provides a list of tips for enhancing your program’s capabilities.

Also take a look at the [Turning Data into Action]({{< ref "2014-06-03-digitalgov-summit-panels-recap.md" >}} "Turning Data Into Action—DigitalGov Summit Recap") panel recap from the Spring Digital Citizen Services Summit to see how agencies ARE using their data to make positive changes and improve the customer experience.

Ken Handwerger from the **National Park Service** (NPS) wrote an article about how [NPS Used the Digital Analytics Program (DAP)]({{< ref "2013-11-06-nps-gov-use-of-digital-analytics-program-beyond-the-numbers.md" >}} "NPS.gov Use of Digital Analytics Program: Beyond the Numbers") to make strategic decisions about how and when to do promotions.

## Upcoming Event

Do you have a plan for making your data open? In this upcoming event, [How to Get Your Agency’s Data on Data.gov]({{< tmp "events/how-to-get-your-agencys-data-onto-data-gov.md" >}} "How to Get Your Agency’s Data onto Data.gov"), you can find out how to leverage the power of Data.gov to open your data.

And of course you can find all of our past training in our [Video Library]({{< ref "/events" >}} "Video Library").
