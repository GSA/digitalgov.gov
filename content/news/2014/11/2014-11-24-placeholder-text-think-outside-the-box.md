The verdict is in. Placeholder text is harmful in search boxes.

Searchers are on your site to complete a task. Having placeholder text **_inside_** a search box distracts from the task and it reduces the [usability]({{< ref "/topics/user-experience" >}}) and [accessibility]({{< ref "/topics/accessibility" >}}) of the search box. Placeholders look simple, but are in fact very tricky to use.

## What Is Placeholder Text?

Placeholder text is the label for possible content in a text box. It can normally be found when there are prompts to fill out a form. It’s the hint that tells you ‘Last name’ or the format with which to enter your birthdate or phone number. Placeholder text typically exists as a hint to fill in actual text.

## Put Labels and Placeholders Outside the Box

These hints can be essential to help identify what information to input, but they shouldn&#8217;t be be put **_inside_** the text box. They should be placed _**outside**_ the box.

> If you include hint text inside your form’s text boxes, many users—quite likely, the majority—will interpret the hint text as a default.

**Inside the Box Is Hard to Use**

**Outside the Box Is Better**

Placeholder text inside the search box can hinder more than help. Some sites use placeholder text within a search box, and inadvertently searchers don’t remove it. This leads to searches with a query consisting entirely of placeholder text, or a query that is an amalgamation of the two.

For example, some sites will have “What are you looking for?” or “Search…” within the search box. Though such hints can be helpful, studies have shown that text in a field makes the search box—and all other types of Web forms and content boxes—less noticeable.

## Conclusion

In summary, avoid inline placeholder text in search boxes. The best solution is to have clear, visible labels and placeholders that are placed outside the box.
