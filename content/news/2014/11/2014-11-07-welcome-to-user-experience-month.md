One challenge with digital government: it&#8217;s hard to see people.

If you work at a U.S. Post Office, you interact with your customers, talk with them, and even see what they are feeling by looking at their faces. You can understand their experience fairly easily. In the digital world, technology decreases physical distance but increases the personal distance between us and our audience. Often we have to make sense of piles of data and user comments to determine if people even like what we offer or find it valuable.

So, in addition to collecting good analytics (like through GSA’s free [Digital Analytics Program]({{< ref "/guides/dap/_index.md" >}} "DAP: Digital Analytics Program")), it&#8217;s crucial to understand your how your customers use your technology on a one-to-one basis. That’s why you focus on the User Experience (or UX); a product&#8217;s ease-of-use, whether it looks nice or creates any emotional friction, and if people can use it to accomplish something they want.

User Experience is closely related to [Customer Experience]({{< ref "2014-07-07-user-experience-ux-vs-customer-experience-cx-whats-the-dif.md" >}} "User Experience (UX) vs. Customer Experience (CX): What’s the Dif?"), and the [User Experience]({{< ref "digitalgov-user-experience-resources.md" >}} "DigitalGov User Experience Program") program that I manage at GSA helps: build UX teams at agencies across the federal government, them to understand their customers&#8217; needs, and build products centered around them.

For this month&#8217;s UX theme, we&#8217;re hitting this topic from lots of angles:

  * The exciting [results from our Federal User Experience research study]({{< ref "2014-11-21-results-2014-federal-user-experience-survey.md" >}} "Results: 2014 Federal User Experience Survey")
  * [How Plain Language saved a Department of Education website]({{< ref "2014-11-14-institute-for-education-sciences-usability-case-study.md" >}} "Institute for Education Sciences – Usability Case Study")
  * See great [recorded presentations about User Experience by DigitalGov University]({{< ref "2014-11-26-usability-events-round-up-2014.md" >}} "Usability Events Round-Up: 2014")
  * How [Accessibility and Usability are similar]({{< ref "2014-11-17-user-experience-impossible-the-line-between-accessibility-and-usability.md" >}} "User Experience Impossible: The Line Between Accessibility and Usability") (and different)
  * (We all love surveys.) [Here’s how to avoid making a bad one]({{< ref "2014-11-10-4-tips-on-great-survey-design.md" >}} "4 Tips on Great Survey Design")
  * Why [slow load times can crush your Responsive Web Design implementation]({{< ref "2014-11-18-trends-on-tuesday-speed-matters-when-measuring-responsive-web-design-performance-load-times.md" >}} "Trends on Tuesday: Speed Matters When Measuring Responsive Web Design Performance Load Times")
  * How to ensure people use your site search? Here’s [one important thing NOT to do]({{< ref "2014-11-24-placeholder-text-think-outside-the-box.md" >}} "Placeholder Text: Think Outside the Box")
