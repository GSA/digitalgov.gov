Is it a phone or is it a tablet? {{< legacy-img src="2014/11/600-x-435-CES-phablet-2013-Consumer-Electronics-Show-Highlights-Newest-Technology-David-Becker-Getty-Images-News-Thinkstock-159184299.jpg" alt="Mobile phone and phablet seen at the 2013 C E S (Consumer Electronics Show)" caption="" >}} 

The International Data Corporation (IDC) predicts that &#8220;phablets,&#8221; the popular term for smartphones with screen sizes from 5.5 to less than 7 inches, [will outship portable PCs this year and tablets in 2015](http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS25077914). Specifically, total phablet volume will top 318 million units, surpassing the 233 million tablets forecast to ship in 2015. Further, IDC expects phablets to grow from 14.0% of the worldwide smartphone market in 2014 to 32.2% in 2018.

The trend is driven by user preference and device cost, but does not mark the end for smartphones. &#8220;While consumers in places like the United States and Western Europe are likely to own a combination of PCs, tablets, and smartphones, in many places the smartphone—regardless of size—will be the one connected device of choice,&#8221; states IDC.
