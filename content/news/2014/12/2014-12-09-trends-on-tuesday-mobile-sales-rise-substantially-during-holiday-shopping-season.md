Were you surfing the pre-Black Friday online sales while waiting for the Thanksgiving turkey to appear on the table? Turns out, you weren’t alone.

“Online sales for Thanksgiving 2014 grew 12.2%, with mobile sales accounting for 74% of that traffic,” [according to Mobile Marketing Watch](http://www.mobilemarketingwatch.com/thanksgiving-day-online-sales-saw-big-jump-year-over-year-46528/). To put that in context, mobile sales grew 26.1% percent over 2013. Whether it’s Thanksgiving, Black Friday or Cyber Monday, mobile is playing an ever increasing role in holiday shopping.

Of course specific retailers differ in mobile traffic. For example [in an article from TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/02/walmart-com-reports-biggest-cyber-monday-in-history-mobile-traffic-at-70-over-the-holidays/), one large retailer reported a “whopping 70%” of online traffic coming from mobile devices over the Thanksgiving-Cyber Monday period.
