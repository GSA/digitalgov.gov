We are in the middle of the holidays, and that means much driving to visit friends and relatives. I was just in Kentucky this past weekend where I spent a total of eight hours driving. I am sure many of you will spend even more time driving in the next three weeks. So, where do you find the best gas prices and how can you maximize your vehicle’s fuel mileage?

Check out the Department of Energy’s <a href="http://www.fueleconomy.gov/trip/#?" target="_blank">FuelEconomy.gov Trip Calculator</a>. Put in your origin and destination, select your vehicle make and model, and you will receive a map of your journey with the best gas prices. If you plan to stay around home for the holidays, you can find local gas prices at <a href="http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/gasprices/states/index.shtml" target="_blank">FuelEconomy.gov’s state gas prices map</a>.

Developers can also build fuel economy apps using <a href="http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/ws/index.shtml" target="_blank">FuelEconomy.gov’s Web services</a>. The Web services offer data based on specific vehicles including emissions data and fuel mileage. Developers can also query for current fuel prices and pair it with the vehicle information to estimate trip costs. There are even Web services to help the developer build an interactive menu for choosing the year, make, and model of the vehicle. Pair FuelEconomy’s Web services with other APIs and developers can create a great holiday trip helper._*API – Application Programming Interface.
