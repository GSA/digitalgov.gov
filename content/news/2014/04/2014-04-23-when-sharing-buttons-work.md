{{< legacy-img src="2014/04/250-x-242-GAO-social-icon.jpg" alt="250-x-242-GAO-social-icon" >}}At the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) we use sharing buttons on our website to help people share content from web pages with their colleagues and friends. With one click, a user can post a page’s link to popular social networking sites or send it via email. The article [_To Use Social Sharing Buttons or Not_]({{< ref "2014-04-02-to-use-social-sharing-buttons-or-not.md" >}}) looks at some ways that social sharing buttons are actually used. Here’s a look at what works for us.

On our main website, GAO.gov, we have sharing buttons on the summary pages of our reports and testimonies, as well as on our topics pages. Similar to our [neighbors in the U.K.](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2014/02/20/gov-uk-social-sharing-buttons-the-first-10-weeks/), we found these sharing rates were generally low. We were happy to see a very different picture when it came to our blog, the [WatchBlog](http://blog.gao.gov/)_._

In January, 2014, GAO [launched a new blog](http://blog.gao.gov/about/) as part of our continuing effort to reach our audiences—Congress and the American people—where they are currently looking for information. Our blog format allows us to provide a little more context about our work than we can offer on its other social media platforms.

The WatchBlog has now been viewed over 12,000 times, with much of the traffic coming from Facebook and Twitter. Readers are also eager to share our blog posts on social media using our sharing buttons. Overall, our sharing rate as a percentage of pageviews is 15.2%.

The five most popular blog posts have sharing rates between 15.2% and 45.2%.
