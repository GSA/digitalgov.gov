The Internet of Things, a concept approaching reality, is best described as objects (think appliance, trees, etc.) in the world equipped with identifying devices or machine-readable identifiers that make them connected to the Web. This [handy infographic](http://www.mobilemarketingwatch.com/infographic-a-brief-history-of-the-internet-of-things-40469/) charts the history and development of the idea and perhaps this [washing machine could be a roadmap](http://www.wired.com/2014/04/this-brilliant-internet-connected-washer-is-a-roadmap-for-the-internet-of-things/?mbid=social_twitter) to the future.

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The fourth annual </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://iotday.org/">Internet of Things Day</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> is Wednesday, April 9th. It was created by the </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.theinternetofthings.eu/content/council-mission">Internet of Things Council</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> to encourage interested people around the world to connect by hosting and attending </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.iotevents.org/">meetups</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">, hackathons, and spending time with others to help jump-start important categories of conversation and collaboration around this technology.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">We&#8217;ve touched on the Internet of Things </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="{{< ref "2013-10-22-tuesday-trends-lets-talk-connected-devices.md" >}}">trends</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> and how Internet of Things relates to </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="{{< ref "2014-03-13-anytime-anywhere-anything-the-effect-of-mobile-on-the-web-in-25-years.md" >}}">mobile</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">, </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="{{< ref "2014-01-28-innovation-means-more-better-cost-effective-digital-training.md" >}}">social media</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> and </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="{{< ref "2013-06-17-or.md" >}}">managing digital</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">. But, in the spirit of Internet of Things day, we wanted to get your thoughts on the issues or opportunities government will face.</span>

One of the big challenges will be privacy and security, and the [Federal Trade Commission sponsored a meetup](http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/events-calendar/2013/11/internet-things-privacy-security-connected-world) on this topic in November. But what other challenges will the Internet of Things bring for government, and how do we overcome them?

Let us know in the comments!
