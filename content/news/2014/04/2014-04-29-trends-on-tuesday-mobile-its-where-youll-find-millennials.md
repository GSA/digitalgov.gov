This generation of tech-natives is adept at accessing large amounts of information held in the palms of their hands. However, their information overload also poses a challenge for agencies competing to gain their attention.

The Center for Media Research presents four suggestions for [crafting a mobile strategy](http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/220100/reaching-millennials-with-mobile.html) that will engage Millennials:

  * **Have a mobile site.** More than 75% of Millennials access the Internet from their phone, with 34% higher click-through rates on their mobile devices.
  * **Create opt-in opportunities.** 90% of Millennials spend time on mobile devices sending and receiving messages, with open rates exceeding 99%. They want relevant campaigns that deliver personalized content.
  * **Got apps?** 60% of Millennials downloads apps to their devices. Using app alerts and push notifications can increase their usage.
  * **Be social.** Millennials want to engage with agencies the same ways they engage with friends. They also want content they can share with their social media connections.
