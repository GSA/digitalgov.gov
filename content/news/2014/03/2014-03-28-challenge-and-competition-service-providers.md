In 2010, GSA was asked to build [Challenge.gov](https://challenge.gov/ "link to Challenge.gov") and set up a schedule (a list of pre-negotiated contracts) that can help federal agencies run [effective challenge and prize competitions]({{< ref "/topics/challenges" >}} "Link to Challenge content on DigitalGov.gov").

We answered the call with [Schedule 541 4G](http://www.gsaelibrary.gsa.gov/ElibMain/sinDetails.do?scheduleNumber=541&specialItemNumber=541+4G&executeQuery=YES "Link to GSA Schedule 541 4G for Challenge and Competition Services").

These contractors can work with you to design your challenge and present it on the Web or on their solver-specific platforms. Many of them have experience with communication strategy, allowing you to reach a large and varied audience or a specialized community. As this image suggests, Schedule 541 4G solution providers can also help you define and figure out how to solve your agency&#8217;s problem.

[Government pricing from each vendor](http://www.gsaelibrary.gsa.gov/ElibMain/sinDetails.do?scheduleNumber=541&specialItemNumber=541+4G&executeQuery=YES "link to GSA Schedule 541 4G for Challenge and Competition Services") is available on GSA.gov.

  There are a number of other crowdsourcing competition platforms that are not on the GSA schedule and you will find that agencies have hired those companies, too. We do not endorse any particular company, process or platform and all contracting schedule questions should be directed to <a title="Link to FAS phone number and email address" href="http://www.gsaelibrary.gsa.gov/ElibMain/sinDetails.do?scheduleNumber=541&specialItemNumber=541+4G&executeQuery=YES">GSA&#8217;s Federal Acquisition Service</a>.
