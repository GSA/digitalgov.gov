Mobile devices are uploading data faster and mobile users are starting to expect better performance, according to Citrix. Fifty percent of web pages are taking 37.5% less time to load on a mobile device than they did just a year ago according the [Citrix Mobile Analytics Report](http://www.citrix.com/news/announcements/feb-2014/data-reveals-mobile-ad-reach-has-doubled-.html).

This [infographic from the study](http://www.citrix.com/content/dam/citrix/en_us/documents/products-solutions/mobile-usage-trends.pdf) shows the percentage of users who abandon a mobile website based on the speed with which it loads:

  * 33% &#8211; 5 seconds to load
  * 54% &#8211; 10 seconds to load
  * 68% &#8211; 20 seconds to load

As the data demonstrates a third of users expect a mobile site to load within 5 seconds. However, these users aren’t necessarily blaming the web site for all delays, as 57% blame the mobile provider when a video stalls.

Agencies optimizing their websites for mobile use need to consider the user’s experience and provide a site that focuses on only the most important user content to ensure quick loading.
