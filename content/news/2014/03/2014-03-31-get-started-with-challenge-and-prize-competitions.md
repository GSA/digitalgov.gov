Well, here are all the resources [GSA&#8217;s Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/25729 "link to OCSIT page on GSA.gov") has to offer:

Put your agency&#8217;s challenges on this government-wide listing and learn about more than 300 public prizes run over the past four years. You can filter by agency and challenge type, such as software, ideas, designs. Built and hosted by GSA, you can also use it to run crowdsourcing competitions end to end.  This is available for federal agencies at no cost. <strong>On-demand webinar:</strong> <a href="{{< ref "2014-03-11-crowdsource-ideas-with-new-competition-platform.md" >}}" target="_blank">Crowdsource Ideas with Competition Platform</a>
