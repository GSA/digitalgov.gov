  One key to developing quality mobile products is testing, as “nearly 50% of consumers will delete an app if they encounter just a single bug.”
</p>

<p>
  As a result the following processes are used to ensure a quality mobile app:
</p>

>   * Manual Testing &#8211;  27.96%
>   * Automated Testing &#8211; 18.16%
>   * API Testing &#8211; 16.12%
>   * Load Testing &#8211; 14.76%
>   * Production Monitoring &#8211; 11.17%
>   * Tool-Assisted Code Review &#8211; 9.42%
>   * Don&#8217;t Know &#8211; 1.84%
>   * Other &#8211; <1%

<p>
  The infographic points out that while manual testing is the single most important process used to ensure quality, Automated, API and Load testing comprise almost 50% of processes utilized.
</p>

<p>
  The good news for mobile apps is that both developers and testers are involved in testing mobile apps:
</p>

>   * Developers and testers &#8211; 64.37%
>   * Testers &#8211; 21.55%
>   * Developers &#8211; 8.05%
>   * Don&#8217;t Know &#8211; 4.89%
>   * Don&#8217;t Test &#8211; 1.15%

Testing is an important part of any mobile app/web development and is why the Mobile Application Development Application program offers [mobile testing resources and guidelines]({{< ref "2013-08-22-mobile-product-testing-guidelines.md" >}}). The program also offers the opportunity to have your mobile web product tested with the [Federal Crowdsource Mobile Testing Program]({{< ref "service_mobile-testing-program.md" >}}).
