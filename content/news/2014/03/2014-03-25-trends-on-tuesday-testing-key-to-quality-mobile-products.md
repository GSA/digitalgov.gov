Building quality mobile products is the greatest challenge for succeeding in the mobile space according to an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140402152641/http://blog.smartbear.com/mobile/the-state-of-mobile-development-and-testing/">infographic by SmartBear</a>.

One key to developing quality mobile products is testing, as “nearly 50% of consumers will delete an app if they encounter just a single bug.”

As a result the following processes are used to ensure a quality mobile app:

 * Manual Testing &#8211;  27.96%
 * Automated Testing &#8211; 18.16%
 * API Testing &#8211; 16.12%
 * Load Testing &#8211; 14.76%
 * Production Monitoring &#8211; 11.17%
 * Tool-Assisted Code Review &#8211; 9.42%
 * Don&#8217;t Know &#8211; 1.84%
 * Other &#8211; <1%

The infographic points out that while manual testing is the single most important process used to ensure quality, Automated, API and Load testing comprise almost 50% of processes utilized.

The good news for mobile apps is that both developers and testers are involved in testing mobile apps:

 * Developers and testers &#8211; 64.37%
 * Testers &#8211; 21.55%
 * Developers &#8211; 8.05%
 * Don&#8217;t Know &#8211; 4.89%
 * Don&#8217;t Test &#8211; 1.15%

Testing is an important part of any mobile app/web development and is why the Mobile Application Development Application program offers [mobile testing resources and guidelines]({{< ref "2013-08-22-mobile-product-testing-guidelines.md" >}}). The program also offers the opportunity to have your mobile web product tested with the Federal Crowdsource Mobile Testing Program.
