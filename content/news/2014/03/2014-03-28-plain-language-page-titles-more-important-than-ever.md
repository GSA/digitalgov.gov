Government Web pages are found mainly through search engines. Google recently [redesigned its search results page](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3027704/how-googles-redesigned-search-results-augur-a-more-beautiful-web) and there are quite a few small, but impactful, changes in this latest redesign.

In addition to the suggestions offered in our [previous article on Achieving Good SEO]({{< ref "2013-05-31-four-steps-to-achieve-good-seo.md" >}}), here are a few specific tips for page titles:

1. Place page titles in a <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag within the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>. 
2. There’s no magic number, but around 55 characters or less is good. 
3. There’s no set syntax, but &#8220;Primary Keyword &#8211; Secondary Keyword | Brand Name&#8221; is good.
