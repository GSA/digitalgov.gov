{{< legacy-img src="2014/06/250-x-440-SaferCar-Android-Apps-on-Google-Play.jpg" alt="Screen capture of the Android Safer Car app on Google Play" >}}With the [start of &#8220;astronomical summer&#8221;](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/news/meteorological-versus-astronomical-summer) later this week on June 21, that means two things: road trips and car buying.

If you&#8217;re doing either or both, best be sure to grab the app for the [SaferCar program](http://www.safercar.gov/) from the Department of Transportation&#8217;s [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration](http://www.nhtsa.gov/About) (NHTSA).

[We blogged about the SaferCar app]({{< ref "2013-04-18-dots-safercar-app.md" >}}) last year when NHTSA [launched the app in iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/safercar/id593086230?ls=1&mt=8), and we are pleased to report that Android users have been brought into the fold with their own version [for download on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.nhtsa.safercar).

  * Buying a car? The app offers 5-Star crash test safety ratings and comparisons for a variety of makes and models.

  * Already own a car? Now all you Android users can get the same real-time recall and safety alerts on your phone â€”as well as submit any safety issues with your own vehicle that, unfortunately, tend pop up at inopportune times (such as when are you driving your entire family to the beach on Day 1 of your hard-earned vacation. Can you relate?)

Don&#8217;t wait: To take a test drive of the SaferCar app for Android or iOS, speed on over to the<span style="color: #555555"> </span><a style="color: #ff5049" href="http://apps.usa.gov/">USA.gov Apps Gallery</a><span style="color: #555555"> and download it today.</span>
