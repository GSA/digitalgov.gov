On June 10, 2014, the Metrics Community of Practice of the Federal Web Managers Council and [DigitalGov University]({{< ref "/about/digitalgov-university.md" >}}) hosted an event to honor the memory of Joe Pagano, a former co-chair of the Web Metrics Sub-Council.

This third lecture honoring Joe focused on search engine optimization (SEO).

While commercial search engines do a remarkable job of helping the public find our government information, as Web professionals, it&#8217;s also our job to help the public make sense of what they find.

I presented on SEO for government websites and specifically talked about:

  * What SEO is and why it is important;
  * SEO building blocks for writing content;
  * Conducting keyword research; and
  * Eliminating ROT (redundant, outdated, and trivial content).
  * Check out the [slide deck](http://www.slideshare.net/DigitalGov/seo-joepagano) and visit the resources below to learn more.
