According to <a title="Thinknear" href="http://www.mobilemarketingwatch.com/mobile-marketers-are-you-near-me-now-41998/" target="_blank">Thinknear</a>, a leader in targeted mobile advertising, that future may soon be a reality.

Here’s what Thinknear found when measuring the accuracy of location data used in mobile advertising:

  * 67% of ad inventory comes with latitude and longitude information compared to 10% a few years ago
  * 34% of mobile impressions are accurate within 100 meters; 9% are between 100 meters and 1000 meters; and 30% are between 1,000 meters and 10,000 meters
  * 20% of mobile location-based ad inventory is outside 10,000 meters—more than six miles off target

Mobile marketers aren&#8217;t the only ones who can benefit from accurate location data. As government communicators, our goal is to connect citizens with services and vital information in their communities.
