With the recent growth of smartphone and tablet ownership, it’s no surprise that U.S. consumers are spending more time on mobile devices than PCs. Mobile usage will rise to nearly three hours per day in 2014, <a title="eMarketer" href="http://mobithinking.com/blog/mobile-overtakes-pc-usa" target="_blank">according to eMarketer</a>. So how does mobile compare to other major media:

  * Mobile usage will rise to 2 hours 51 minutes in 2014, up from 2 hours and 19 minutes in 2013.
  * PC consumption is estimated to contract to 2 hours 12 minutes in 2014, down from 2 hours 19 minutes the previous year.
  * Mobile usage more than doubles time spent on radio (1 hour 26 minutes) and print (32 minutes).
  * Only time watching TV—4 hours 31 minutes—surpassed time spent on mobile media in 2013.
