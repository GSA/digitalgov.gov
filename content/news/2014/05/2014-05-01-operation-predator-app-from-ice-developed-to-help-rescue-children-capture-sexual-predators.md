It&#8217;s disturbing to think about, but essential for all of us to know about: The sexual abuse and exploitation of children.

When it comes to rescuing those children and investigating, locating and arresting suspected child predators, &#8220;[it&#8217;s a race against the clock](http://www.ice.gov/news/releases/1309/130912washingtondc.htm),&#8221; says [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement&#8217;s](http://www.ice.gov) (ICE) Acting Director John Sandweg. Luckily there&#8217;s a mobile tool to help beat that clock back a bit.

{{< legacy-img src="2014/04/600-x-400-ICE-operation-predator-image-1-and-4.jpg" alt="Two screen shots of mobile app; the splash screen with the ICE branding, and the Alerts screen with mug shots of wanted predators." >}}

Touted as the first of its kind in U.S. law enforcement, **[Operation Predator app](http://www.ice.gov/predator/predator-app.htm)** is harnessing the power of the mobile crowd to gather critical information worldwide, quickly and easily. Available for iPhone users, the app will also be expanded for wider mobile application.

Through the app screen (and also by phone or online), anyone can submit anonymous tips to the ICE Tip Line about suspected predators—either wanted fugitives or previously unknown—24 hours a day, seven days a week.

The public can also:

  * View a list of wanted suspects, as well as those who have been arrested;
  * Share news and information with their social network;
  * Get the latest updates on the status of listed suspects; and
  * Access a list of online resources regarding missing and/or exploited children.

The officials at ICE have just one important caveat, though: &#8220;Do not attempt to apprehend any suspects; please refer any information to law enforcement officials.&#8221;
