We won’t build the government of the 21st century by [drawing within the lines]({{< ref "2014-05-07-because-its-hard.md" >}}).

We don&#8217;t have to tell you the hard work of building a digital government doesn&#8217;t exist in a vacuum or a bubble. Show us social media without mobile, Web without data and user experience without APIs. You can&#8217;t? That&#8217;s right—in reality, digital government intersects and cuts across boundaries every day in order to deliver the digital goods.

To get ourselves thinking outside the lines in order to build an awesome 21st century government we’re bringing federal, industry and state and local employees together for the [DigitalGov Citizen Services Summit]({{< tmp"events/digitalgov-citizen-services-summit.md" >}}) on Friday, May 30.

In our event’s panels and Expo, we’ll showcase programs that are combining, collaborating and colluding across technology boundaries to improve:

* How agencies operate internally
* How agencies collaborate together
* How agencies engage with citizens

Following an opening keynote by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) CIO, David Bray, our four panels will focus on:

* performance analysis,
* customer service across channels,
* public private partnerships and
* inter-agency work.

These panels will explore how agencies can integrate their [data]({{< ref "/topics/code" >}}), [social media]({{< ref "/topics/social-media" >}}), [user experience]({{< ref "/topics/user-experience" >}}), [mobile development]({{< ref "/topics/mobile" >}}) and other programs in order to achieve the best improvements for citizen services. Confirmed speakers include:

* Jack Bienko, Small Business Administration (SBA)
* Denise Shaw, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
* Sarah Kaczmarek, U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO)
* Michael Pulsifer, Department of Labor (DOL)

You can sign up for the event and see our [ever-expanding speaker list on the event page](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.digitalgov.gov%2Fevent%2Fdigitalgov-citizen-services-summit%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGiwao6z6PUtq_tcRPW1QVfhf-9WA).

Our Expo will showcase innovations and shared services across the federal government. We have 30 tables available (and they&#8217;re going fast) for federal agencies to showcase projects and introduce yourselves to all the federal employees, contractors and state and local participants. Let us know your interest during the registration process &#8230; don&#8217;t think for a second that your program, large or small, isn&#8217;t the jam we are looking for
