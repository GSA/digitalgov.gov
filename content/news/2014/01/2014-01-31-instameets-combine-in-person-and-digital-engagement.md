**Instameets** can achieve this strategic goal by using **Instagram** with meetups to amplify the vision of your mission.

**Katie Harbath**, global lead for politics and government engagement at **Facebook**, joined us at **DigitalGov University** for a webinar to share with agencies how they can plan Instameets, and some of the nuts and bolts of managing Instagram.

Highlights of the presentation include:

  * Bringing your organization to life through photos
  * Extending Instagram conversations on Facebook
  * Experimenting and learning about your audience
  * Bringing the Instagram experience into your platforms
  * Leveraging Facebook and Instagram to get the most out of your campaign

Also, please remember to RSVP and join us for &#8220;Triple Threat: Managing, Measuring and Archiving Government Social Media&#8221; on Wednesday, Feb. 5. During this session Hootsuite will demonstrate to agencies how they can manage multiple accounts, collect and report robust performance analysis and automate archiving for records management &#8212; all in one dashboard.

Itâ€™s all part of our ongoing effort to bring you more of the best in social media for government training each week through DigitalGov University. We hope you can join us.
