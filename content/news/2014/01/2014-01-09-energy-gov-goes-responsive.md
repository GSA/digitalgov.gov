Did this week&#8217;s polar vortex wreak havoc on your heating and cooling system? Maybe now you&#8217;re in the hunt for a new furnace or looking for more efficient ways to keep warm?

Just in time for the epic deep freeze, the team at the [Department of Energy](http://energy.gov/about-us) has created a much improved web experience for users of their Energy Saver and other popular programs with the launch of a shiny new version of [Energy.gov](http://energy.gov/) built with the latest in [responsive design]({{< ref "2013-06-11-responsive-design.md" >}} "Responsive Design Overview, Resources and Tools") functionality.

Whether on a smartphone, tablet or desktop computer, now you&#8217;ll get optimized browsing on Energy.gov, a hub for a host of DOE products and services including:

<ul class="how_to_mobile_list">
  <li>
    Featured access to the ever-popular <strong><a href="http://energy.gov/energysaver/energy-saver">Energy Saver</a></strong> content right from the homepage;
  </li>
  <li>
    A newly designed <strong><a href="http://energy.gov/savings/search?f%5B0%5D=im_field_location_state%3A1549">Tax Credits, Savings and Rebates tool</a></strong> that simplifies and speeds your search for rebates for your state of residence and offers an improved visual display of data, among other enhancements (see the upper right hand corner of the Energy.gov homepage.)
  </li>

    A vibrant and visually engaging <strong><a href="http://energy.gov/articles/best-2013-our-favorites-photo-week">multimedia gallery</a></strong> of photos and videos<a href="http://energy.gov/articles/best-2013-our-favorites-photo-week"><br /> </a>
  </li>
</ul>

Like many federal agencies, DOE has seen its mobile traffic increase significantly. According to their blog, more than 15 percent of traffic to Energy.gov comes from smaller screens on smartphone and tablets. The site redesign has not only made for a more efficient and visually pleasing browsing experience for all visitors, but it also brings DOE&#8217;s most in-demand content right to users&#8217; fingertips wherever and however they choose to surf Energy.gov.

So grab a mug of hot cocoa, cozy up to your space heater, fire up your favorite mobile device and check out the new Energy.gov.
