We are struck by how much data was transferred via a WiFi connection vs. cellular. People are using WiFi connections way more than cellular ones.

Some other quick highlights:

  1. In Q2 of 2013, 4x as much data was transferred over a WiFi connection vs. Cellular connection.
  2. Top 5 States with WiFi Bandwidth are VA, DE, NJ, MA, and NH. Bottom 5 States were AK, ID, WY, MT, and KY.
  3. Mobile app usage of Facebook, Instagram, and Loudtalks up 200%.
  4. National Bandwidth from the 1st to 2nd Quarter of 2013 WiFi Bandwidth increased twice as much as cellular.
