</p>

<p>
  There are still many other questions about responsive web design and it’s time to provide some illumination.
</p>

<p>
  Next Thursday, February 6, we are providing an opportunity for agencies to talk about these questions. At our <strong>Responsive Web Design Workshop: Why, How and What’s Next? </strong>workshop, we’re bringing Aids.gov, Department of Labor, Federal Student Aid, National Cancer Institute, GSA and other agencies together to talk about the ins and outs of responsive web design implementations.
</p>

<p>
  The event will answer three big questions:
</p>

- Why do responsive web design?
- How should an agency implement responsive web design?
- Once responsive web design is implemented, how do you stay future ready?

Have you implemented or are you planning to implement a responsively designed site?

<p>
  Come help us answer these questions, update/build some new mobile <a title="Mobile User Experience Guidelines and Recommendations" href="{{< ref "mobile-user-experience-guidelines-and-recommendations.md" >}}">user experience recommendations</a> and get your agency’s responsive implementation a leg up!
