**Tax time.**

And just in (tax)time, the [Internal Revenue Service](http://www.irs.gov/) has updated its handy **IRS2Go Mobile App** for [iPhone/iTouch](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/irs2go/id414113282?mt=8) and [Android phones](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.irs&hl=en).

The 2014 version of the app offers a more elegant and streamlined visual experience &#8212; and a few convenient new features including:

  * The **Refund Status tab** now has a &#8220;status tracker&#8221; for users to see the status of their tax returns. If you [file your taxes](http://www.irs.gov/Filing) electronically, you can check on a refund owed to you 24 hours after filing. (Paper-filers must wait about a month before checking on their refund as processing times take longer for paper submissions.)

  * A tab for users to find **Free Tax Prep Providers** near their residence (Note: you must meet criteria to qualify for these programs). A maps feature offers the option for directions to the providers that interest you.

  * The option to **Stay Connected** to IRS via its social media properties like Twitter and YouTube, via email or through traditional means.

As in the previous version of IRS2Go, you can request a hard copy of your tax return right from the app (under &#8220;**Tax Records&#8221;**), which the IRS says will be mailed to you &#8220;within several business days.&#8221; Another plus: The app is bilingual, offering versions in both English and Spanish.
