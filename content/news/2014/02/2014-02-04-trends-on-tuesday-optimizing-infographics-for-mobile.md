Here are some tips on making sure your visual content, like infographics, create good visual user experiences.

 **1. Infographics should tell a story.** Explain the key point’s people need to consider in your graphic.

 **2. Think device agnostic.** Don’t risk alienating your visitors by focusing on one device. Test your infographic on multiple devices. Consider the small but high resolution screens that users will be viewing your infographics on.

 **3. Think about your target audience.** Consider their pain points and dreams and how you can help. Think about what they find interesting and helpful.

 **4. Don’t make your infographic too complex.** Break your big ideas into sections. Make sure you have an eye catching design and logical flow from one section to the next but keep it simple!

 **5. Have an outreach plan.** Even your best infographic won’t magically go viral. Again think of your target audience, what blogs or websites are they reading? Look at maximizing social sharing.
