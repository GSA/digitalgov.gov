Launched last year in “beta” by Secretary Sebelius, <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/idealab/pathways/hhs-ignite/" target="_blank">HHS Ignite</a> supports early-stage projects that can be completed in tight time frames. Ignite is part of HHS’s <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/idealab/" target="_blank">IDEA Lab</a>, which was established to improve how the Department delivers on its mission and promote advances in organizational management.

From a pool of 65 proposals, 13 teams were selected, and over the last six months, these HHS Ignite (Beta) teams have been solidifying their problem and testing their idea in a way to gather actionable data. Through pivots, procurement, and a government shutdown, the teams have emerged to present the results of their efforts.

This Friday, February 7th, come hear your colleagues from ACF, ACL, CDC, FDA, IHS, NIH, and OS as they present their HHS Ignite (beta) projects and pitch to a Department “Investor Panel” for continued funding and support of their idea.

From 10:00 – 12:30 EST, join us in-person in the Humphrey Building Auditorium or tune-in online. Hope to see you there!

**HHS Ignite Innovation Day**
  
Friday February 7, 2014

By exposing teams to a network of innovators and equipping them with the methodologies and tools used by successful start-up companies, HHS Ignite provides a start-up environment in which small teams can try something new.

We begin accepting proposals for the next round of Ignite on March 3rd. <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/idealab/pathways/hhs-ignite/" target="_blank">Learn more about HHS Ignite</a>.
