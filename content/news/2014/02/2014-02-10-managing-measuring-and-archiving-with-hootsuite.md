title: Managing, Measuring and Archiving with Hootsuite
summary: Federal workers need to know more in social media than just how to send a tweet. Among other things, you also need to manage multiple accounts across platforms and languages; measure and report performance; and archive posts and comments for the public record. We dispelled the notion that technology limits agencies from tackling these challenges

Among other things, you also need to manage multiple accounts across platforms and languages; measure and report performance; and archive posts and comments for the public record.

We dispelled the notion that technology limits agencies from tackling these challenges by highlighting how agencies can achieve all these in one dashboard — and in the process hope it opened eyes to all the possibilities available to government.

Eve Belanger, Strategic Account Manager, and Sajji Hussain at HootSuite, one of the services available to agencies with a federal-friendly terms of service, joined DigitalGov University to share how agencies could use the HootSuite dashboard to address these crucial needs.

Highlights of the presentation include:

  * Using tabs and streams to monitor feeds and hashtags
  * Archiving tweets, even from search streams
  * Building analytics reports through engagement templates or customize to fit your needs
