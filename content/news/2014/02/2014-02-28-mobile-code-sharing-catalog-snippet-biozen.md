Check out [BioZen, available on the Mobile Code Sharing Catalog](http://gsa.github.io/Mobile-Code-Catalog/native_android.html#complete), one of the first mobile applications to provide users with live biofeedback data covering a range of bio-physiological signals, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyography (EMG), galvanic skin response (GSR), electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), respiratory rate, and temperature biofeedback data and display it on a mobile phone.
  
You can find out more at [BioZen&#8217;s official site](http://www.t2.health.mil/apps/biozen).

BioZen is just one of the many pieces of open source code available on the [Mobile Code Sharing Catalog](http://gsa.github.io/Mobile-Code-Catalog/index.html) hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
