Money for college? It&#8217;s never too early &#8212; or too late, for that matter &#8212; to start schooling oneself in the possibilities of federal financial aid.

Following in the footsteps of their StudentAid.gov website, the digital team at Ed.gov&#8217;s <a href="http://studentaid.ed.gov" target="_blank">Federal Student Aid</a> (FSA) closed out 2013 with [the launch](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/new-financial-aid-toolkit-part-department%E2%80%99s-efforts-improve-college-access-and-affordability) of <a href="http://financialaidtoollkit.ed.gov" target="_blank">FinancialAidToolkit.ed.gov</a>, a &#8220;sister&#8221; site featuring a flexible, easy-to-access responsive design.
