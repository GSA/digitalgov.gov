_**Update:** Join us next `Weds, July 17 @ 2pm ET` for "[An Introduction to 10x and How to Get Your Idea Funded](https://digital.gov/event/2019/07/17/an-introduction-10x-how-get-your-idea-funded/)" — [Register here »](https://digital.gov/event/2019/07/17/an-introduction-10x-how-get-your-idea-funded/)_

The two most important principles to adhere to when building a new digital product are ‘start small’ and ‘validate your ideas.’ These two concepts are at the heart of [10x](https://10x.gsa.gov/) — a technology investment program housed in the [Technology Transformation Services](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services) (TTS) office at the [U.S. General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov/) (GSA) — that funds new ideas to help the federal government deliver better products and services.

The [10x process](https://10x.gsa.gov/the-10x-process/) counters traditional government funding practices where investments are typically large and require a full project plan before funding is granted. 10x is modeled after modern venture capital practices that use small, gated investments and give projects the flexibility to become more focused and prevent massive sunk costs as the idea matures. This approach is designed to spend fewer taxpayer dollars while also ensuring the best products and services are funded.

There are four key phases that a project could progress through — investigation, discovery, development, and scale — and at the end of each phase, project teams either justify continued investment or recommend that the work stop.

10x firmly believes that the best ideas often come from the people who work closest to the problem — so, anyone in the federal government is invited to submit project ideas to 10x.

**The 10x team is looking to fund ideas that:**
