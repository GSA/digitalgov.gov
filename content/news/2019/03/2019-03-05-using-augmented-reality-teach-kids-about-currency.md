In 2016, the Federal Reserve Board’s [U.S. Currency Education Program](https://www.uscurrency.gov/about-us) (CEP) began its search for an innovative way to teach young students about Federal Reserve notes. When researching how elementary-aged students learn new topics in the classroom, we noticed a strong trend in effective mobile-based instruction. We then identified which mobile technologies teachers use in American classrooms.

Over time, the CEP created youth-focused materials that teachers and students could use on mobile devices. We developed and tested a prototype mobile app with elementary-aged children in early 2018. Following the participants’ feedback, we implemented a thorough project plan to develop the proof-of-concept into a viable product for public use.

The CEP launched the Money Adventure mobile app on the Apple App Store in January 2019. [Money Adventure](https://www.uscurrency.gov/educational-materials/classrooms/money-adventure-mobile-app) is an interactive smartphone and tablet app that teaches the next generation of cash users about the unique features of Federal Reserve notes.

Money Adventure facilitates a playful learning environment, similar to [Currency Academy](https://www.uscurrency.gov/educational-materials/classrooms/currency-academy), the CEP’s web-based classroom content. Students can explore the features of a virtual $20 note or embark on an augmented reality quest using the detailed artwork on the back of banknotes.

The app is currently available for download on Apple's [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/money-adventure/id1446642877). After download, the app is fully usable without an internet connection. The Android version is scheduled to launch in late 2019.
