We are excited to announce our 2019 [Presidential Innovation Fellows](https://www.presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/) (PIF) who have begun their “tour of duty” in American tech. These seventeen entrepreneurs, technologists, and designers will help shape the frontiers of innovation in the federal government bringing their agile leadership and vitality to eleven agencies.

“Civic tech service has become an American tradition,” says Joshua Di Frances, executive director of the Presidential Innovation Fellows program. “PIFs have been working alongside federal agencies for the past six years, helping deliver faster and smarter services for the American public.”

In 2018, for instance, PIF Fellows were instrumental in strengthening public-private engagement on a range of national security and criminal issues, as well as helping develop tech sector strategies. They helped agencies prioritize initiatives and execute on projects; they helped create artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities and cybersecurity strategies; and they were instrumental in the passing of new legislation — the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA).

Subsequently, PIF Michael Brown was promoted to Director of the Defense Innovation Unit. “My time as a PIF was extremely rewarding since I was able to work on questions of national importance and support the efforts to drive meaningful change,” says Brown.
