In January 2017, the [U.S. Access Board](https://www.access-board.gov/) published a [final rule](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/final-rule) updating information technology (IT)accessibility requirements covered by Section 508 of the [Rehabilitation Act of 1973](https://www.access-board.gov/the-board/laws/rehabilitation-act-of-1973), which includes IT that is developed, procured, maintained, or used by federal agencies. The Rehabilitation Act is a federal law which requires programs and activities funded by federal agencies to be accessible to people with disabilities, including federal employees and members of the public. [Here’s a recap of the changes](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/overview-of-the-final-rule).

Compliance with the [Revised 508 Standards](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/final-rule/text-of-the-standards-and-guidelines) is also a requirement of [OMB M-17-06, Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites and Digital Services](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2017/m-17-06.pdf) (PDF, 1.2 MB, 18 pages, November 2016). They went into effect on January 18, 2018. [Watch this video to learn more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DKw4jEGmaXbw).

## What’s New
Notable changes to the Standards include:

*   Incorporation of the [W3C’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/), to harmonize with other accessibility standards worldwide.
*   Requirement that all public-facing official agency business content (and specific categories of non-public-facing content that is official agency business) must be accessible.
*   Requirements are now organized by functionality, instead of product type, to more easily keep pace with rapid advances in technology.

## Get Started

Your first stop for guidance on the new Standards is the [Revised 508 Standards Toolkit Policy Refresh](https://section508.gov/refresh-toolkit). Developed by GSA’s Government-wide 508 Program, the US Access Board, and the Federal CIO Council Accessibility Community of Practice, it’s the central hub for Standards implementation guidance.
