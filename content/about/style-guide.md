:tada: Welcome to the Digital.gov style guide!

Below you’ll find guidance for voice and tone, author bios and photos, branding, grammar, images, plain language, inclusive language, and more. We will soon update details on _how_ to submit to Digital.gov.

## Voice and Tone

Articles for Digital.gov—written by employees from across the federal government—use an informal, conversational tone.

### Conscious Inclusivity

Not everyone who uses government services or engages with federal agencies are U.S. citizens. When appropriate, use phrases or words such as: the public, users, people, or folks.

Additionally, where possible:

* Avoid using gendered pronouns; instead, use they or their.
* Avoid age-related descriptions of people unless absolutely necessary for the content; in those cases, try using older people or older person—instead of elderly or senior.

See the **18F Content Guide** for more on inclusive language: https://content-guide.18f.gov/inclusive-language/

## Grammar and Spelling

In general, we follow [AP Style](https://www.apstylebook.com/). Use [plain language](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/) in your writing for clarity. Avoid using acronyms or [jargon](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/08/15/get-out-of-the-jargon-trap-plain-language-training-can-help/) that may be unfamiliar to the general public or those outside your agency.

### Capitalization

Capitalize proper nouns for people, places, and agency names.

Do not capitalize words like _federal_, _government_, or _agency_ unless it is:

* The first word in a sentence
* An official title for or name of something
* In a title or header (see _Content Titles and Headers_ below)

### Publication Titles

Blogs, magazines, books, etc. are in normal text (i.e., no italics or underlining). Ideally, the titles will be linked to the work that is being referenced.

### Courtesy and Professional Titles

On first reference, introduce people by their first and last names without a courtesy title (e.g., Mr., Mrs., Miss, Ms., Sir, Madam, Dr.).

If a person's gender isn't clear from their first name (e.g., Chris, Pat, Lesley, Jean), make this clear by referring to them by the appropriate pronoun after the first reference.

### Content Titles and Headers

#### Format

We use [title case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Title_case) for for all titles and paragraph headers. Only use end punctuation for headers that pose a question (e.g., What Did We Learn?). If you’re unsure, many free, web-based title case tools use the filters to get AP Style (Examples: [titlecase.com](http://www.titlecase.com) and [capitalizemytitle.com](http://www.capitalizemytitle.com)).

#### Size

Article titles should be set to H1, with any subsequent headers set as H2, H3, and so forth, in hierarchical order.

Do not use H3 or below to attempt to make the text appear bold; just apply bold formatting to the text with the Formatting Toolbar in Google Docs or Microsoft Word.

### Numbers, Symbols, Dates, Time, and Places

#### Numbers

- Write out all nine numbers under 10, except for percentages
- Use the word percent; not the percent sign (use twenty-three percent, not 23%)

#### Symbols

Unless the symbol is part of a name or branding, use the word (e.g., use the word _and_ instead of an ampersand & or a plus sign +).

#### Dates

- Use the expanded form of Month Day, Year (e.g., February 16, 2018) to avoid confusion that may arise by using the numeric format—for users in some other countries, 01/11/2018 would mean November 1st; not January 11th.
    - For specific dates, use the full, four-digit year
- Can abbreviate for informal dates (the ‘90s)
- Include ordinal indicators (st, nd, rd, th) on dates (e.g., use November 23rd instead of November 23)

#### Time

- Time descriptors “ante meridiem” (before noon) and “post meridiem” (after noon) should be abbreviated with lowercase letters as am and pm, respectively.
- Use the 12-hour clock (8:00 am, 4:00 pm)
- Avoid redundancies, such as, "10 am this morning"
- Seasons (winter, spring, summer, fall, autumn) are not capitalized

#### Places

- When referring to a number of states, the word “state” should be lowercase (e.g., All 50 states responded.)
- Locations
    - District of Columbia: abbreviate as D.C. in copy, but use the official postal code, DC (without periods), for an address
    - United States: abbreviate as U.S.
    - In copy, spell out state names, such as California. This will help keep naming conventions consistent (while the 2-character abbreviation without periods is the current postal standard for addresses in U.S. states and territories, older versions are still used by some people), and it can help avoid confusion; people often mix up the abbreviation for Louisiana (LA) with the one for Los Angeles (L.A.)

### Agency Abbreviations

#### Initialisms and Acronyms

To avoid confusion, always provide the full name of an agency or program the first time you mention it, followed by its abbreviation (an initialism or acronym) within parentheses. You can then use just the abbreviation elsewhere in the copy. Example:

> _Lorem ipsum **National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)** dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat._
>
> _Duis aute irure dolor **NASA** in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum._

**Initialism examples**:

OMG, LOL, BIA, GSA, FBI, OPM, SEO, CMS, HTML, CSS

**Acronym (an initialism that is used as a word) examples**:

scuba (scuba self contained breathing apparatus), laser (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation), radar (RAdio Detection And Ranging or RAdio Direction And Ranging), WYSIWYG, WCAG, NASA, OPEC, NARA, DARPA, INTERPOL, NATO, FEMA, SWAT

**_Note_**: Avoid redundancies, such as, “ATM machine” (automated teller machine machine) and “PIN number” (personal identification number number).

##### Pluralization

There is no need to add an _s_ to the end of an initialism or acronym if a word in the original name is already plural.

For example, we use **CoE** for _Centers of Excellence_. Adding an _s_ on the end—CoEs—would actually mean, _Centers of Excellences_.

### Punctuation

#### Commas

In writing, oral pauses are indicated by commas. They are also used to order things, like lists, [clauses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49EsnvxVQec), or a series of terms. Much like debates over [what counts as a sandwich](https://twitter.com/matttomic/status/859117370455060481) and [the proper pronunciation for the image file type, _gif_](https://www.cnn.com/2013/05/22/tech/web/pronounce-gif/index.html), disagreements about whether or not to use an Oxford comma (also known as the _Harvard comma_ and the _serial comma_) are quite common.

It can be confusing (or potentially [costly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/03/16/the-ruling-in-this-maine-labor-dispute-hinged-on-the-omission-of-an-oxford-comma/) in [unexpected](https://www.instagram.com/p/BSTmAS2lZ_6/) ways) to omit the Oxford comma, so, we’d like to err on the side of caution. As noted by [AP Stylebook in their Twitter Chat on September 12, 2017](https://twitter.com/APStylebook/status/907673471865507841):

- “We don't ban Oxford commas! We say: If omitting a comma could lead to confusion or misinterpretation, then use the comma.”
- “But: If a comma doesn't help make clear what is being said, don't use it. "The flag is red, white and blue" is clear.”

So, use your best judgement. If anything is unclear, we’ll help you clarify.

#### Colons

After a colon, capitalize the next word if it starts a complete sentence (i.e., is not a [fragment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_clause_structure#Incomplete_sentence)).

#### Apostrophe Abuse

Use an apostrophe to indicate:

- Possession—”Agile also improves the development team’s ability to commit to work.”
- Missing letters or numbers
    - Contractions: ”For example, with a bilingual English/Spanish website, we would’ve clearly labeled captions (for English text) and subtitles (for Spanish text).”
    - Date abbreviations: ”the ‘90s” (the apostrophe replaces the _19_ in _1990s_)

Do not use an apostrophe to make words plural.
Ever.
Ev. Er.
😉

#### Em Dash

You can easily offset a phrase within a sentence with the long [em dash](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/why-you-should-love-the-em-dash/) — instead of using parentheses, commas, colons, etc. (see link for examples).

#### Lists (Bulleted, Numbered)

If it’s a complete sentence, use punctuation (usually a period) at the end of the list; not after every bullet point.

If it’s a list of fragments, do not use punctuation at the end. Capitalize the first word in each bullet point.

#### i.e., vs. e.g.,

e.g. (_exempli gratia_), which is Latin for “for example, ...” use it to list one or more examples

i.e. (_id est_) is Latin for “in other words, ...”

## Digital.gov Branding

The overarching name of the site is Digital.gov. You may see references to “DigitalGov” in our archives, but going forward, it should be referred to as “Digital.gov”.

### Branded names and initialisms or acronyms for related services and programs:

- **[Digital Analytics Program](https://www.digital.gov/dap/)** (DAP)
    - dap’s dashboard website domain and name are the same: [analytics.usa.gov](https://analytics.usa.gov)
- **DigitalGov Search** was renamed: **[Search.gov](https://www.digital.gov/services/search/)**
- **[Digital.gov University](https://www.digital.gov/digitalgov-university/)** (DGU)
- **[Federal CrowdSource Mobile Testing Program](https://www.digital.gov/services/mobile-application-testing-program/)** (no acronym)
- **[U.S. Digital Registry](https://www.digital.gov/services/u-s-digital-registry/)** (no acronym; replaced the Federal Social Media Registry and the Federal Mobile Products Registry)
- **U.S. Web Design Standards** was renamed: **[U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/)** (USWDS)

Additionally, we often abbreviate Community of Practice as CoP, and we have [over 20 communities](https://digital.gov/communities/) listed on Digital.gov. However, they are run by federal employees at agencies across the federal government, so they don’t always follow the same naming conventions. If writing about them or topics covered in their listservs, you can get the full, proper name (and any alternates) from their individual Community pages on Digital.gov.

Name examples include: MobileGov, SocialGov, OpenGov, Open Data, PLAIN, Government Contact Center Council (G3C), Web Content Managers Forum, and Federal Community of Practice on Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science (CCS).
