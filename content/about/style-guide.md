:tada: Welcome to the Digital.gov style guide!

Below you’ll find guidance for voice and tone, author bios and photos, branding, grammar, images, plain language, inclusive language, and more. We will soon update details on _how_ to submit to Digital.gov.

## Voice and tone

Articles for Digital.gov—written by employees from across the federal government—use an informal, conversational tone.

### Conscious inclusivity

Not everyone who uses government services or engages with federal agencies are U.S. citizens. When appropriate, use phrases or words such as: the public, users, people, or folks.

Additionally, where possible:

* Avoid using gendered pronouns; instead, use they or their.
* Avoid age-related descriptions of people unless absolutely necessary for the content; in those cases, try using `older people` or `older person` &mdash; instead of _elderly_ or _senior_.

See the **18F Content Guide** for more on inclusive language: https://content-guide.18f.gov/inclusive-language/.

## Grammar and spelling

In general, we follow [AP Style](https://www.apstylebook.com/). Use [plain language](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/) in your writing for clarity. Avoid using acronyms or [jargon](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/08/15/get-out-of-the-jargon-trap-plain-language-training-can-help/) that may be unfamiliar to the general public or those outside your agency.

### Capitalization

Capitalize proper nouns for people, places, and agency names.

Do not capitalize words like _federal_, _government_, or _agency_ unless it is:

* The first word in a sentence.
* An official title for or name of something (e.g., Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)).

### Content titles and headers

#### Format

**December 2022**: We are switching from [title case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Title_case) to [sentence case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Sentence_case) for all titles and paragraph headers.

Headlines are key to a story. They have to stand on their own in conveying the story, and must include key context. They should tempt readers to want to read more, without misleading or overpromising. A concise, well-worded headline will tempt readers to want to learn more. Try to keep titles to under 64 characters.

Think carefully about keywords, search engine optimization (SEO), and social media optimization. Which terms are users likely to be searching for? What will be easily recognizable and compelling in your headline? Include keywords that are central to the story’s content, and consider what keywords relevant to the story are trending in search engines and social media.

Use numerals; do not spell out numbers except in casual uses or formal names: use _hundreds_ instead of _100s_; _Big Ten_; or _one of the first_. Also use numerals for ordinals, such as: _2nd_, _9th_, etc.

Capitalize only the first word and proper nouns in headlines. If the title contains a colon, the first word after a colon is always uppercase in headlines.

Only use end punctuation for headers that ask a question (e.g., What Did We Learn?).

_**A few examples**_:

Title case: `18F Checks in With Jerome Lee and the eAPD Project`<br />
**New sentence case**: `18F checks in with Jerome Lee and the eAPD project`

Title case: `How Effective Is Your Communication?`<br />
**New sentence case**: `How effective is your communication?`

Title case: `User Experience (UX) vs Customer Experience (CX): What’s the Dif?`<br />
**New sentence case**: `User experience (UX) vs customer experience (CX): What’s the dif?`

If you’re unsure, many free, web-based title case tools use filters to set AP Style and title case (Examples: [capitalizemytitle.com](http://www.capitalizemytitle.com) and [titlecase.com](http://www.titlecase.com)).

#### Size

Article titles should be set to H1, with any subsequent headers set as H2, H3, and so forth, in hierarchical order.

Do not use H3 or below to attempt to make the text appear bold; just apply bold formatting to the text with the Formatting Toolbar in Google Docs or Microsoft Word.

### Publication titles

Blogs, magazines, books, etc. are in normal text (i.e., no italics or underlining). Ideally, the titles will be linked to the work that is being referenced.

### Courtesy and professional titles

On first reference, introduce people by their first and last names without a courtesy title (e.g., Mr., Mrs., Miss, Ms., Sir, Madam, Dr.).

If a person's gender isn't clear from their first name (e.g., Chris, Pat, Lesley, Jean), make this clear by referring to them by the appropriate pronoun after the first reference.

### Numbers, symbols, dates, time, and places

#### Numbers

- Write out all numbers under 10.
- Use numbers with the percent symbol (e.g.; 0.9%, 7%, 23%), but use words instead of figures in casual use (She said he has a zero percent chance of winning.).

#### Symbols

- Use a forward slash `/` between words can be ambiguous; do not use one to replace words like _and_ or _or_.
- Unless a symbol is part of a name or branding, use the word (e.g., use the word _and_ instead of an ampersand `&` or a plus sign `+`).

#### Dates

- Use the expanded form of _Month Day, Year_ (e.g., February 16, 2022) to avoid confusion that may arise by using the numeric format; for users in some other countries, 01/11/2018 would mean November 1st; not January 11th.
    - For specific dates, use the full, four-digit year
- Can abbreviate for informal dates (the ‘90s)
- Include ordinal indicators (st, nd, rd, th) on dates (e.g., use November 23rd instead of November 23)

#### Time

- Time descriptors "ante meridiem" (before noon) and "post meridiem" (after noon) should be abbreviated with lowercase letters as am and pm, respectively.
- Use the 12-hour clock (8:00 am, 4:00 pm)
- Avoid redundancies, such as, "10 am this morning"
- Seasons (winter, spring, summer, fall, autumn) are not capitalized

#### Places

- When referring to a number of states, the word "state" should be lowercase (e.g., All 50 states responded.)
- Locations
    - District of Columbia: abbreviate as D.C. in copy, but use the official postal code, DC (without periods), for an address
    - United States: abbreviate as U.S.
    - In copy, spell out state names, such as California. This will help keep naming conventions consistent (while the 2-character abbreviation without periods is the current postal standard for addresses in U.S. states and territories, older versions are still used by some people), and it can help avoid confusion; people often mix up the abbreviation for Louisiana (LA) with the one for Los Angeles (L.A.)

### Agency abbreviations

#### Initialisms and acronyms

To avoid confusion, always provide the full name of an agency or program the first time you mention it, followed by its abbreviation (as an initialism or acronym) within parentheses. You can then use just the abbreviation elsewhere in the copy. Example:

> _Lorem ipsum **National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)** dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat._
>
> _Duis aute irure dolor **NASA** in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum._

**Initialism examples**:

An initialism is an acronym where you pronounce each letter.

- OMG &mdash; Oh, my God (or gosh)
- LOL &mdash; laughing out loud
- BIA &mdash; Bureau of Indian Affairs
- GSA &mdash; U.S. General Services Administration
- TTS &mdash; Technology Transformation Services
- FBI &mdash; Federal Bureau of Investigation
- CDC &mdash; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
- OPM &mdash; U.S. Office of Personnel Management
- SEO &mdash; search engine optimization
- CMS &mdash; content management system, call management system, or Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS))
- HTML &mdash; HyperText Markup Language
- CSS &mdash; Cascading Style Sheets

**Acronym examples**:

An acronym is an initialism that is used as a word.

- scuba &mdash; Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus
- laser &mdash; Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation
- radar &mdash; Radio Detection and Ranging
- WYSIWYG (pronounced: Whizzy-wig) &mdash; What You See Is What You Get
- WCAG (pronounced: way-cag or wuh-cag) &mdash; Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
- NIOSH (pronouned: nigh-osh) &mdash; National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
- NASA &mdash; National Aeronautics and Space Administration
- OPEC (pronounced: oh-peck) &mdash; Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
- NARA &mdash; National Archives and Records Administration
- DARPA &mdash; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
- NATO (pronounced: nay-toe) &mdash; North Atlantic Treaty Organization
- FEMA &mdash; Federal Emergency Management Agency
- SWAT &mdash; special weapons and tactics

**_Note_**: Avoid redundancies, such as, "ATM machine" (automated teller machine machine) and "PIN number" (personal identification number number).

##### Pluralization

There is no need to add an _s_ to the end of an initialism or acronym if a word in the original name is already plural.

For example, we use **CoE** for both _Center of Excellence_ and _Centers of Excellence_. Adding an _s_ on the end &mdash; CoEs &mdash; would be, _Center of Excellences_.

### Punctuation

#### Commas

In writing, oral pauses are indicated by commas. They are also used to order things, like lists, [clauses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49EsnvxVQec), or a series of terms. Much like debates over [what counts as a sandwich](https://twitter.com/matttomic/status/859117370455060481) and [the proper pronunciation for the image file type, _gif_](https://www.cnn.com/2013/05/22/tech/web/pronounce-gif/index.html), disagreements about whether or not to use an Oxford comma (also known as the _Harvard comma_ and the _serial comma_) are quite common.

It can be confusing (or potentially [costly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/03/16/the-ruling-in-this-maine-labor-dispute-hinged-on-the-omission-of-an-oxford-comma/) in [unexpected](https://www.instagram.com/p/BSTmAS2lZ_6/) ways) to omit the Oxford comma, so, we’d like to err on the side of caution. As noted by [AP Stylebook in their Twitter Chat on September 12, 2017](https://twitter.com/APStylebook/status/907673471865507841):

- "We don't ban Oxford commas! We say: If omitting a comma could lead to confusion or misinterpretation, then use the comma."
- "But: If a comma doesn't help make clear what is being said, don't use it. "The flag is red, white and blue" is clear."

So, use your best judgement. If anything is unclear, we’ll help you clarify.

#### Colons

After a colon, capitalize the next word if it starts a complete sentence (i.e., is not a [fragment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_clause_structure#Incomplete_sentence)).

#### Apostrophe abuse

Use an apostrophe to indicate:

- Possession &mdash; "Agile also improves the development team’s ability to commit to work."
- Missing letters or numbers
    - Contractions: "For example, with a bilingual English and Spanish website, we would’ve clearly labeled captions (for English text) and subtitles (for Spanish text)."
    - Date abbreviations: "the ‘90s" (the apostrophe replaces the _19_ in _1990s_)

Do not use an apostrophe to make words plural.
Ever.
Ev. Er.
😉

#### Em dash

You can easily offset a phrase within a sentence with the long [em dash](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/why-you-should-love-the-em-dash/) — instead of using parentheses, commas, colons, etc. (see link for examples).

#### Bulleted and numbered lists

If it’s a complete sentence, use punctuation (usually a period) at the end of the list; not after every bullet point.

If it’s a list of fragments, do not use punctuation at the end. Capitalize the first word in each bullet point.

#### i.e., vs. e.g.,

These two terms are not interchangeable; each has its own meaning and usage.

The abbreviation "i.e." stands for the Latin phrase, _id est_, which means "that is" or "in other words."

> Since 1977, _Star Wars_, which belongs to a sub-genre of science fiction (i.e., the _space opera_ or _science fantasy_), has released nine main live-action films in the Skywalker Saga, and three spin-off films; two live-action, and one computer-animated film.

The abbreviation "e.g." stands for the Latin phrase _exempli gratia_, which means "for example" &mdash; use it to list one or more examples.

> Since 1966, _Star Trek_ has been a shining example of diversity, equity, and inclusion (e.g., lead characters who are: women and people of color, people with disabilities, and folks in the LGBTQIA+ community). Each of its 13 TV series and 13 films represent the creator's vision for a society with "infinite diversity in infinite combinations" (IDIC).

#### versus

Spell the word out in regular writing, and when quoting someone:

> "The proposal to revamp Medicare versus proposals to reform Medicare and Medicaid at the same time is ..."

In short expressions, however, use of the abbreviation _vs._ is permitted:

> The comparison of Star Trek vs. Star Wars has long been an issue with fans of the sci-fi genre.

For court cases, use _v._:

> Haaland v. Brackeen

## Digital.gov branding

The overarching name of the site is Digital.gov. You may see references to "DigitalGov" in our archives, but it should be referred to as "Digital.gov" going forward.

### Branded names and initialisms or acronyms for related services and programs:

- **[Digital Analytics Program](https://www.digital.gov/dap/)** (DAP)
    - dap’s dashboard website domain and name are the same: [analytics.usa.gov](https://analytics.usa.gov)
- **DigitalGov Search** was renamed: **[Search.gov](https://www.digital.gov/services/search/)**
- **[Digital.gov University](https://www.digital.gov/digitalgov-university/)** (DGU)
- **[Federal CrowdSource Mobile Testing Program](https://www.digital.gov/services/mobile-application-testing-program/)** (no acronym)
- **[U.S. Digital Registry](https://www.digital.gov/services/u-s-digital-registry/)** (no acronym; replaced the Federal Social Media Registry and the Federal Mobile Products Registry)
- **U.S. Web Design Standards** was renamed: **[U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/)** (USWDS)

Additionally, we often abbreviate Community of Practice as CoP, and we have [over 20 communities](https://digital.gov/communities/) listed on Digital.gov. However, they are run by federal employees at agencies across the federal government, so they don’t always follow the same naming conventions. If writing about them or topics covered in their listservs, you can get the full, proper name (and any alternates) from their individual Community pages on Digital.gov.

Name examples include: MobileGov (mobile site, apps, devices), SocialGov (Social Media), OpenGov, Open Data, PLAIN, Government Contact Center Council (G3C), Web Content Managers Forum, and Federal Community of Practice on Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science (CCS).
