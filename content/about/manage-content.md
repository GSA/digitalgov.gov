The team at Digital.gov works to ensure the site’s content meets user needs and advances [our mission](https://digital.gov/about/#mission).

To maintain and curate the most useful experience possible, we regularly evaluate our web content for accuracy, relevance, and other indicators of quality. If the content does not meet our criteria, we may refresh or repurpose it. Alternatively, we may remove outdated or redundant content from the website.

When Digital.gov content is removed, we make reasonable efforts to ensure that it is available in public, archival repositories. For example, you can browse the [GitHub repository for this site](https://github.com/GSA/digitalgov.gov/) to access all content, including the history for each individual page.

## About Digital.gov’s evaluation schedule

At regular intervals outlined in the evaluation schedule table, we evaluate web content based on several factors, including:

- **Usefulness**: Accurate and thoughtfully organized
- **Accessibility**: Conformance with [IT accessibility laws and policies](https://www.section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies/), including Section 508 standards
- **Relevance**: Alignment with user needs
- **Quality**: Well-written and appropriately structured

We may make exceptions outside of the established schedule if web analytics, accessibility and quality checks, or other indicators of current user needs reveal that changes need to be made.
