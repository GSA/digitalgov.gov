{{< card-policy src="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/a11.pdf" kicker="Policy" title="OMB Circular A-11, Part 6, Section 210.6" >}}

When developing performance information for publication, agencies should be open, transparent, and accountable for results of progress against stated performance goals and objectives, publishing information online consistent with the Federal Records Act, privacy and security restrictions, and other applicable law and policy including [OMB Circular A-130](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/legacy_drupal_files/omb/circulars/A130/a130revised.pdf), Managing Information as a Strategic Resource. It is important that agencies communicate relevant, reliable, and timely performance information within and outside their organizations to improve performance outcomes and operational efficiency.

Consistent with the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, information published through Performance.gov will be made available to the public in a machine-readable format. See section 240 for additional information on an initiative to make agency performance plans and reports ‘machine readable’ with the 2021 Budget and Performance Planning / Reporting cycle.

## Do/Don't Table:

{{< do-dont-table caption="When participating in the community, community members must follow the ground rules for discussions." >}}
{{< row >}}
{{< do-row >}} Share your pronouns. Even if you are not in the LGBTQI+ community, you can choose to share your pronouns when introducing yourself to a new person, when speaking on a group call, etc. This helps normalize the act of sharing pronouns in all settings and prevent “outing” transgender or gender nonconforming people. (Outing someone is when their identity is exposed without their consent.) {{< /do-row >}}
{{< dont-row >}} Don’t take offense if someone shares their pronouns or asks about your pronouns. {{< /dont-row >}}
{{< /row >}}

{{< row >}}
{{< do-row >}} Add your own pronouns, if you’re comfortable sharing them, in your email signature or other places your name is displayed. {{< /do-row >}}
{{< dont-row >}} Don’t share your pronouns if you are not comfortable or ready. {{< /dont-row >}}
{{< /row >}}

{{< row >}}
{{< do-row >}} If you’re unsure of someone’s pronouns, use their name or just ask. {{< /do-row >}}
