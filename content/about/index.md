# Hello worlds and people!

We all live in a time when [more pre-schoolers can use a smartphone app than can
tie their shoes](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/01/preschoolers-better-
at-navigating-iphone-than-tying-their-shoes/). How does government prepare to meet the information needs of these budding citizens? **DigitalGov** means providing information and services to the public anywhere and anytime. This site is a platform to help those in agencies working on providing digital services and information for the public. We'll scour the innerwebs for digital info so you don’t have to. Expect posts on what government is doing in digital, general digital news, trends and issues on implementing digital for the public.

## Less on Us

This platform is brought to you by the [Office of Products and Programs](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/124174)—formerly known as the
Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies (OCSIT)—in the
[Technology Transformation Service](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/25729)
(TTS) of the U.S. [General Services
Administration](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100000). Our job here is to help agencies build a 21st century digital government. We do that by:

  * Finding and sharing resources and capabilities throughout government
  * Helping agencies understand and resolve policy issues
  * Offering services and tools to help agencies meet their digital government goals
  * Championing DigitalGov solutions from loosening data to developing mobile development guidelines to app and website development to best practices and policy
  * Promoting agency DigitalGov efforts
  * Building relationships with the private and non-profit sectors as well as state and local government

### Digital Government Division & Multiplication

The Digital Government Division is a cooperative enterprise that draws on
resources from across government to leverage the expertise of forward-leaning
agencies. To that end, we’re gathering a cadre of innovators to help build a
digital government that meets the expectations of the public while delivering
info and services safely and securely. The Digital Government Division is a
key component supporting the goals of the [Digital Government
Strategy](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-
government/digital-government.html) and is sponsored by GSA.
