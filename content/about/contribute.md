Digital.gov provides guidance on building better digital services in government. Do you have a case study or success story to share? Did your team recently accomplish something noteworthy?

We’re always on the lookout for ideas from our [community members](https://digital.gov/communities/).

## How to contribute content and events

Agency stories are an important tool to empower and support colleagues who are working to improve digital content. Digital.gov gathers ideas and expertise from across the federal government and shares that information with thousands of community members, readers, and event attendees.

### 1. Check if you are eligible to contribute.

We welcome ideas and expertise from folks across all levels of experience. You must belong to at least one Digital.gov community and be a federal employee or contractor with an official government email. In most cases, this is a .gov or .mil account. Federal employees must have approval from their supervisors for all work submitted to Digital.gov. Federal contractors must have approval from their federal product manager, Contracting Officer’s Representative, or both. We cannot accept promotional content or pitches from the public.

### 2. Make sure your contribution aligns with our users’ needs.

Not sure what to share? Digital.gov focuses on creating content with direct and actionable connections to digital services. We are looking for ideas that will help generalists, technologists, and teams in the federal government create world-class digital experiences. 

You can find examples of recent case studies and stories in our [blogs](https://digital.gov/news/) and on our [resource](https://digital.gov/resources/) pages. If you’re interested in pitching an event, check out our [video archive of past events](https://youtube.com/@DigitalGov).

### 3. Write and share your pitch.

Write a 3-5 sentence summary of your idea and the content type you have in mind, like a blog or an event. Email this pitch to [digitalgov@gsa.gov](mailto:digitalgov@gsa.gov).

If you’re submitting an event, you can also use our [event submission form](https://feedback.gsa.gov/jfe/form/SV_1MS3YC4dieV8WQm).

### 4. Digital.gov’s editorial team reviews the pitch.

We accept and review pitches on a rolling basis. Our team will look at your idea to determine the right format or event type, relevance to our audience, and match to our mission and goals.

### 5. Work with our content strategists and editors to produce the content or event.

If your pitch is accepted, we’ll work with you to produce the content. This can include interviewing relevant stakeholders, editing for style and voice, and making sure it is reviewed by subject matter experts. We aim to publish written content within 6 to 8 weeks from the time work begins. Most events are held 8 to 12 weeks after they are proposed.

**Did you know?** Digital.gov follows the [Associated Press (AP) Stylebook](https://www.apstylebook.com/) and [general plain language guidance](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/). When we make edits, it’s to ensure the content reaches and engages our audience. View our full [Digital.gov Style Guide](https://digital.gov/style-guide/).

## Submit requests in GitHub

Do you want to request a content update, report a bug, or suggest a feature? Use the green "New Issue" button on [our GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/GSA/digitalgov.gov/issues). When filling out the issue, apply any relevant labels (in the right column), and be sure to:

* include the URL of the page
* describe the issue or request

## Other ways to contribute

While we welcome event and content ideas from community members across all levels of experience, we know that can feel like a big leap, especially for folks who are new to the federal government or Digital.gov. So, we offer other ways to contribute.

### Community mailing lists

Join our [Digital.gov Communities of Practice](https://digital.gov/communities/) to share your thoughts and ideas on the community mailing lists. All community members can post messages on the mailing lists. And be sure to join several communities. Each community has its own culture, and you don’t have to be an expert to join and learn something new.

### Feedback

We want to hear from you! We use feedback from community members and the public to continually improve Digital.gov. Complete our post-event, website, and community surveys, or write to us at [digitalgov@gsa.gov](mailto:digitalgov@gsa.gov) to share what’s on your mind.

### Open Opportunities

We occasionally post short, recurring tasks on the Open Opportunities platform. Each task takes about 8 hours. [Browse all Digital.gov tasks](https://openopps.usajobs.gov/search?state=open&state=in%20progress&term=digital.gov&page=1) to find one that is a good fit for you.
