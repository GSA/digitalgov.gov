**Contribution requirements**

**Who:** We welcome insights and expertise from folks across all levels of experience. You must belong to at least one Digital.gov community and be a federal employee or contractor with a .gov or .mil email. Federal employees must have approval from their supervisors for all work submitted to Digital.gov. Federal contractors must have approval from their federal product manager, COR, or both. We cannot accept promotional content or pitches from the public.

**When:** We accept contributions on a rolling basis.

**Why:** We will share your story with tens of thousands of community members, readers, and event attendees. You and your team deserve the recognition!

**How:** Email digitalgov@gsa.gov to submit your ideas.{{< /box >}}

## How to contribute content and events
### Web content
Agency stories are an important tool to empower and support colleagues who are working “in the trenches” to improve digital content.

Email [digitalgov@gsa.gov](mailto:digitalgov@gsa.gov) to submit your ideas for web content. We will review your ideas and provide feedback, prioritizing the ideas that best align with our mission and audience. We will also share an easy-to-follow content template with you. You’ll have a few weeks to write the content and submit it to us. Then, our editorial team will copy edit the content and publish it on Digital.gov and related channels.

* [Resources](https://digital.gov/resources/): Submit a 300- to 500-word guidance document, checklist, toolkit, style guide, or other similar resource to help agencies improve their digital content.

* [Blog posts](https://digital.gov/news/): Submit a newsworthy 500- to 750-word article to share a case study, success story, or challenge you faced while working to make federal digital services better for the public.

{{< box color="light-gray" >}} **Did you know?** Digital.gov follows the [Associated Press (AP) Stylebook](https://www.apstylebook.com/) and [general plain language guidance](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/). When we make edits, it’s to ensure the content reaches and engages our audience. View our full [Digital.gov Style Guide](https://digital.gov/style-guide/).{{< /box >}}

### Informational events
[Digital.gov events](https://digital.gov/events/) highlight the work federal employees are doing across government to improve digital services and provides a range of free events — from huddles to webinars to summits — for people and teams across the federal government.

Email [digitalgov@gsa.gov](mailto:digitalgov@gsa.gov) to volunteer to present or moderate at an event. You can also submit ideas for event topics in the [Digital.gov event submission form](https://feedback.gsa.gov/jfe/form/SV_1MS3YC4dieV8WQm). Speakers must be federal employees or federal contractors presenting along with their federal counterparts. Read our [Guidelines for Digital.gov event presenters](https://digital.gov/resources/guidelines-for-digital-gov-event-presenters/) to know what to expect.

* **Webinars:** Webinars generally consist of a 15- to 20-minute presentation followed by a moderated Q&A session. Most webinars are open to the public.

* **Huddles:** Huddles provide Digital.gov community members a place to discuss specific topics, share best practices, and spark ideas. Community huddles generally consist of a 5- to 10-minute presentation followed by a moderated, open mic discussion among panelists and community members.

## Other ways to contribute
While we welcome event and content contributions from community members across all levels of experience, we know that can feel like a big leap, especially for folks who are new to the federal government or Digital.gov. So, we offer other ways to contribute.

**Open Opportunities:** We occasionally post short, recurring tasks on the Open Opportunities platform. Each task takes about 8 hours. [Browse all Digital.gov tasks](https://openopps.usajobs.gov/search?state=open&state=in%20progress&term=digital.gov&page=1) to find one that is a good fit for you.

**Community mailing lists:** Share your thoughts and ideas on the community LISTSERV. Tell us about your agency and team and some of your noteworthy projects. Share best practices and resources. Ask questions about new research, industry trends, and other topics. All community members can post messages on the LISTSERV. And be sure to [join several Digital.gov communities of practice](https://digital.gov/communities/). Each community has its own culture, and you’ll learn something new by joining more than one community.

**Feedback:** We want to hear from you. We use feedback from community members and the public to continually improve Digital.gov. Complete our post-event, website, and community surveys, or write to us at [digitalgov@gsa.gov](mailto:digitalgov@gsa.gov) to share what’s on your mind.
