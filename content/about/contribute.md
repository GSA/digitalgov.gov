## How to contribute content and events
### Web content
Agency stories are an important tool to empower and support colleagues who are working “in the trenches” to improve digital content. 

Email [digitalgov@gsa.gov](digitalgov@gsa.gov) to submit your ideas for web content. We will review your ideas and provide feedback, prioritizing the ideas that best align with our mission and audience. We will also share an easy-to-follow content template with you. You’ll have a few weeks to write the content and submit it to us. Then, our editorial team will copy edit the content and publish it on Digital.gov and related channels. 

* [Resources](https://digital.gov/resources/): Submit a 300- to 500-word guidance document, checklist, toolkit, style guide, or other similar resource to help agencies improve their digital content. 

* [Blog posts](https://digital.gov/news/): Submit a newsworthy 500- to 750-word article to share a case study, success story, or challenge you faced while working to make federal digital services better for the public. 

{{< box color="light-gray" >}} **Did you know?** Digital.gov follows the [Associated Press (AP) Stylebook](https://www.apstylebook.com/) and [general plain language guidance](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/). When we make edits, it’s to ensure the content reaches and engages our audience. View our full [Digital.gov Style Guide](https://digital.gov/style-guide/).{{< /box >}}

### Informational events
[Digital.gov events](https://digital.gov/events/) highlight the work federal employees are doing across government to improve digital services and provides a range of free events — from huddles to webinars to summits — for people and teams across the federal government. 

Email [digitalgov@gsa.gov](digitalgov@gsa.gov) to volunteer to present or moderate at an event. You can also submit ideas for event topics in the [Digital.gov event submission form](https://feedback.gsa.gov/jfe/form/SV_1MS3YC4dieV8WQm). Speakers must be federal employees or federal contractors presenting along with their federal counterparts. Read our [Guidelines for Digital.gov event presenters](https://digital.gov/resources/guidelines-for-digital-gov-event-presenters/) to know what to expect.

* **Webinars:** Webinars generally consist of a 15- to 20-minute presentation followed by a moderated Q&A session. Most webinars are open to the public.

* **Huddles:** Huddles provide Digital.gov community members a place to discuss specific topics, share best practices, and spark ideas. Community huddles generally consist of a 5- to 10-minute presentation followed by a moderated, open mic discussion among panelists and community members.
