Our mission is to transform how government learns, builds, delivers, and measures digital services in the 21st century.

And we do that by providing people in the federal government with the tools, methods, practices, and policy guidance they need to deliver effective and accessible digital services.

It is our job to be the experts in the problems people in government face, and support them wherever they may be blocked.


## Our Guiding principlies

### 1. Elevate digital literacy and understanding

We aim to unpack complexity and make it possible for a wide audience to confidently understand digital.

### 2. Bring a human focus to digital

We cannot talk about technology without talking about the people who create it, and the people it affects.

### 3. Don’t fear the problems

We believe talking about challenges and unsolved problems is as important as talking about proven solutions.

### 4. Make collaboration easy

Open collaboration across government is critical to a secure, digital future. It’s Digital.gov’s job to enable collaboration and make it easier.

### 5. Listen

Everything we do is informed by what our audience needs. We apply multiple methods for measuring, listening, and understanding to our products.

### 6. Work in the open

We do all of our work in the open and strive to organize our work in ways that allow others to participate.

We’ve found that agencies need:

- Guidance on implementing digital policies and initiatives
- Open access to modern methods, practices, policies, and tools
- Focused trainings and events that help teams learn and adopt new concepts
- Easy access to collaborate with others across government who are working on the same problems

## What we are working on

Over the last decade, DigitalGov has become a destination in government to learn about the methods, practices, policies and tools that are needed to create effective digital services.

And we believe DigitalGov should set the example for how government learns, builds, delivers and measures digital services in the 21st century.

We are building DigitalGov into a destination that practices the methods that it teaches, and along the way, we are going to tell the story of how we get there, using the very tools that are available in the open, across the government.
