To help prevent exploitation from unofficial sources, phishing scams, or malicious entities, the [**U.S. Digital Registry**](https://usdigitalregistry.digitalgov.gov/) serves as a resource for agencies, citizens, and developers to confirm the official status of social media and public-facing collaboration accounts, mobile apps, and mobile websites.

The accounts in the registry are independently updated by federal managers across the government who maintain individual agency accounts.

## How to Access the U.S. Digital Registry

{{< button href="https://usdigitalregistry.digitalgov.gov/admin" text="Register and Manage Accounts" >}}

Federal agencies are directed to update these accounts in the U.S. Digital Registry per [OMB Memo M-17-06](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2017/m-17-06.pdf), _“Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites and Digital Services,”_ which states:

> “To help confirm the validity of official U.S. Government digital platforms, within 60 days of the publication date of this Memorandum, agencies must register their public-facing digital services such as social media, collaboration accounts, mobile apps and mobile websites, with the U.S. Digital Registry at: [http://www.digitalgov.gov/services/u-s-digital-registry/](http://www.digitalgov.gov/services/u-s-digital-registry/).”

**To register and manage accounts on the U.S. Digital Registry** you must have a  [Login.gov](http://login.gov/)  account, which is available to federal government employees and contractors with a valid .gov, .mil, or .[fed.us](http://fed.us/)  email address.

1. Go to the  [U.S. Digital Registry](https://usdigitalregistry.digitalgov.gov/)

1. In the top navigation bar, far right, access the "`LOG IN`" link. You'll be brought to the  [Login.gov](http://login.gov/) log in page for the U.S. Digital Registry.

If you already have a  [Login.gov](http://login.gov/)  account with your government email address, you won't have to do anything else. Just use that account information to register or to access accounts on U.S. Digital Registry.

If you don't already have a  [Login.gov](http://login.gov/)  account with your government email address, follow the instructions to create an account.

_Need assistance with your accounts, email [usdigitalregistry@gsa.gov](mailto:usdigitalregistry@gsa.gov)_

**Notice:** As of April 19, 2018, all entries that have not been updated by agencies since January 1, 2017 have been archived. Archived accounts will not appear in the public facing list and API of official, active accounts. This was done to help ensure that users can trust that accounts listed in the U.S. Digital Registry are official and active.

If your federal agency account has been archived but is still active, you can easily log-in and update these accounts to make them active again. In the meantime, GSA will continue to help agencies fulfill this need by providing support and guidance.
