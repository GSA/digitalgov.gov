Armed with only a mobile device, federal volunteer mobile product testers provide a valuable service to federal agency mobile development efforts through the Federal CrowdSource Mobile Testing Program. Volunteer testers contribute 1-2 hours per test cycle checking out the latest federal mobile sites and logging feedback into GitHub.

In return, testers

* See the new web-based apps first
