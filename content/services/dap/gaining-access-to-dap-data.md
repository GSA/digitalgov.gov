Any federal employee or contractor who works for a participating agency can register for access to the Digital Analytics Program (DAP) reporting interface, so long as the agency point of contact (POC) approves. In order to gain access to the data, please [email DAP Support](http://dap@support.digitalgov.gov?subject=User%20Access%20Request) with the subject line “User Access Request.” A member of the team will reply with instructions and a link to a form to register, and your POC will be cc’d for approval. 

## Eligible Email Addresses

Contrary to common belief, **you do not need a Gmail address to access Google Analytics**; in fact, the DAP team does not allow for individual personal Gmail addresses to be used in the DAP account. Instead, you will need to associate your .gov or contractor email address with Google. 

If your agency already uses Google for email or Google Suite, no action is needed. If your agency email address isn’t already associated, you must associate your .gov or .mil or authorized contractor email address with Google Analytics at [https://accounts.google.com/SignUpWithoutGmail?hl=en](https://accounts.google.com/SignUpWithoutGmail?hl=en). **Do not create a new Gmail address**. Once you have associated your official email address, [send an email to DAP Support](http://dap@support.digitalgov.gov?subject=registration%20form%20request) and request a registration form. Please also let us know in that email that you have associated your official email account. 

**NOTE: Do you have a gmail.com address linked to your .gov email address (potentially as a backup)?**, If so, you will have to unlink those accounts in order to become a DAP user. We can send you instructions to help unlink the accounts. Also, linking those addresses after being granted access could result in your personal gmail.com address becoming the "primary" account, and you may be subject to removal from our system.
