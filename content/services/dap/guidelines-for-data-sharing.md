The Digital Analytics Program (DAP) maintains a wealth of data from the DAP Google Analytics account at [analytics.usa.gov](https://analytics.usa.gov/), and also offers an API for that data. Any data appearing on that public dashboard can be freely communicated or shared.

The DAP team often receives requests for information related to specific agencies or websites from journalists, researchers, and academics. Our policy is to refer any data requests for information more granular than what is available on analytics.usa.gov to the agency’s DAP point of contact (POC). It’s the agency’s discretion to provide data related to their sites beyond what is already publicly available. Occasionally, we also receive [Freedom of Information Act](https://www.foia.gov/) (FOIA) requests that we refer to the agency in question.

As a user, we ask that you observe similar data confidentiality practices. By logging in and accessing the Digital Analytics Program account, you understand and agree that: 

- Access to the government-wide view of the Digital Analytics Program (DAP) is to assist participating agencies in improving websites across the government.
- Access to this full set of data is restricted to DAP users only.
- Each participating agency controls the distribution and sharing of their own agency-specific data, at the discretion of the agency’s designated DAP POC.
- Agencies are not authorized to communicate or share findings derived from the DAP account about another agency without the other agency’s explicit, written permission (unless those data are already part of the data publicly available on analytics.usa.gov).
