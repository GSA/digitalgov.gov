The Digital Analytics Program (DAP) offers a web analytics tool, training, and support to federal agencies. The program is a shared service provided by the [Technology Transformation Services](http://www.gsa.gov/tts) (TTS) at the [U.S. General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov) (GSA).

On November 8, 2016, the [Office of Management and Budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/) (OMB) released a memorandum on [Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites and Digital Services](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2017/m-17-06.pdf)(PDF, 1.2 MB, 18 pages), which requires federal agencies to implement the DAP JavaScript code on all public facing federal websites.
