<div class="deck"><p>The GSA Office of Government-wide Policy is proud to announce the successful launch of its newest IT Portfolio management tool, Folio. Folio, designed by the Federal eCPIC Steering Committee (FESCOM), is the successor to the Electronic Capital Planning and Investment Control (eCPIC) application, which served as the premier government-wide shared service for over 15 years! This modern application provides federal agencies with new benefits through Folio’s improved user interface, flexible data collection capabilities, and modern technology stack.</p></div>

If you are interested in learning more about the Folio tool, please [email the project management office](mailto:folio.pmo@gsa.gov) for additional information and to schedule a demonstration.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Below are frequently asked questions (FAQs) that come up during demonstrations of the Folio software.

**Why did you modernize to Folio?**

Modernizing to Folio eliminated the pains of maintaining a legacy eCPIC application while providing an intuitive UX, flexible data collection, and a modern technology stack.

**How was Folio created?**

Folio was created in three phases: vision, design, and develop. The Folio lifecycle incorporated key modernization goals in each phase, a user-centered design approach, and continuous iteration and development.

1. **Vision**: GSA worked with agencies to select key goals and prioritize functionality.
2. **Design**: We relied on usability testing and tiger teams to gather and incorporate frequent user feedback.
3. **Develop**: We developed (and will continue to develop) in agile iterations to test, adjust, and release Folio functionality on a regular basis.

**Does Folio integrate with other tools?**

Yes, to best support the differing needs of each agency, Folio development relies on an API First strategy. Folio’s API Gateway allows agencies to integrate with the IT Dashboard and other external sources, including internal agency tools.
