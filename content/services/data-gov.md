## Benefits & Features

Data.gov is the U.S. government’s open data site, providing users access to datasets generated by the Executive Branch of the federal government. Users can find open government data on a wide range of subjects, ranging from education, health, public safety, climate change and much more.

Providing open data as a default through Data.gov is a requirement of the federal [Open Data Policy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-13.pdf). Open data is a core component of the Administration’s initiative on open government as well as the [U.S. Open Government National Action Plan](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/open/partnership/national-action-plans) (NAP) under the [Open Government Partnership](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/).

## How to Participate

Federal agencies looking to publish their datasets on Data.gov should read the detailed guide: [How to get your open data on Data.gov]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/how-to-get-your-open-data-on-data-gov/). The Data.gov team works with a designated open data liaison for each agency. Data publishers should consult with their agency’s open data liaison or point of contact to publish datasets on Data.gov.
