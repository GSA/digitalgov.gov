## Frequently Asked Questions

Below lists Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) asked during demonstrations of the Folio software.

**Why did you modernize to Folio?**

Modernizing to Folio eliminated the pains of maintaining a legacy eCPIC application while providing an intuitive UX, flexible data collection, and a modern technology stack.

**How was Folio created?**

Folio was created in three phases: **Vision**, **Design**, and **Develop**. The Folio lifecycle incorporated key modernization goals in each phase, a user-centered design approach, and continuous iteration and development.
1. **Vision**: GSA worked with agencies to select key goals and prioritize functionality.
2. **Design**: We relied on usability testing and Tiger Teams to gather and incorporate frequent user feedback.
3. **Develop**: We developed (and will continue to develop) in agile iterations to test, adjust, and release Folio functionality on a regular basis.

**Does Folio integrate with other tools?**

Yes, to best support the differing needs of each agency, Folio development relies on an API First strategy. Folio’s API Gateway allows agencies to integrate with the IT Dashboard and other external sources, including internal agency tools.
