eCPIC is a web-based, government-owned and operated software as a service (SaaS), created in 2003 by a handful of  agencies that believed together they could build a common tool to help them manage their IT projects, programs, and portfolios by pooling their resources. As a result, the eCPIC application was born in 2004. Since that time, eCPIC Agency Partnership has grown to 75% of the [Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/101st-congress/house-bill/5687) agencies and nearly 50% of the non-Defense dollars were reported to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) through the tool.

## Our Goals:

  * Happy Federal Partners
  * Mature the level of IT Capital Planning and IT Investment Management controls and processes across federal agencies.
  * Assist OMB to create effective guidance and provide value added oversight by being their IT capital planning and IT investment management subject matter expert
  * Increase Agency adoption of the eCPIC tool
  * Modernize the eCPIC application to improve current capability, take advantage of modern technologies, and ensure the future security of the eCPIC tool

**Is there an additional cost associated with adapting eCPIC to meet changing OMB requirements?**

No. Agencies that are part of the eCPIC Service Level Agreement (SLA) receive software updates at no additional cost.
