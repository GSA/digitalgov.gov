## Can you easily interpret content associated with graphic elements?

**Why it’s important:** Marisa primarily uses her mobile device to browse websites and has trouble interpreting visualizations with small text.

### Steps to take
- Include visual elements in line with text rather than separated from it; a graphic’s proximity to associated content helps reinforce the relationship between the visual and its written description.
- Make sure all graphics have descriptive captions (if necessary). Also make sure that captions share a common form and voice.
- Consider presenting dense technical language in a format other than as part of a graphic. When compressed to mobile view (in other words, a harder-to-read format), graphs and charts with technical language can be tough to interpret.
