question: Can you easily interpret content associated with graphic elements?

### Steps to take
- Include visual elements in line with text rather than separated from it; a graphic’s proximity to associated content helps reinforce the relationship between the visual and its written description.
- Make sure all graphics have descriptive captions (if necessary). Also make sure that captions share a common form and voice.
- Include meaningful information describing each graphic element in the alt text.
- Use null (empty) alt text when text describing the graphic element is already on the page (`alt=""`).
- If the graphic element is decorative and you don’t want the screen reader to announce it at all, use  null (empty) alt text (`alt=""`).
- Consider presenting dense technical language in a format other than as part of a graphic. When compressed to mobile view (in other words, a harder-to-read format), graphs and charts with technical language can be tough to interpret.
