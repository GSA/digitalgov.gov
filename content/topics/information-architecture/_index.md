# Topic Title
title: "Information architecture"
deck: "Organize the information on your website to make it findable, understandable, and usable."

summary: "Websites are made up of information, and information needs to be organized to be useful. Information architecture (IA), which has roots in physical spaces like libraries and hospitals, should be designed with intention in order to help people easily find what they need to know or do.

Making sure that search, labeling, appropriate nesting, clear calls-to-action, and sitemap are clear and usable is all part of having a functional information architecture. Good information architecture builds trust with the public; when information is easy to find, it enhances transparency."
