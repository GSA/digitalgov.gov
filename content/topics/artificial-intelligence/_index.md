summary: "Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology where machines are programmed to learn, reason, and perform in ways that simulate human intelligence. Although AI technology took a dramatic leap forward, the ability of machines to automate manual tasks has been around for a long time. Today’s AI can analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and trends, providing insights to improve decisions in areas like resource allocation and risk management. Follow your agency’s guidance on security and best practices when using AI."
