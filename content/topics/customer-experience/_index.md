deck: "Improving customer experience drives better results in the federal government"

summary: "Customer experience (CX) is the sum of the public's interactions with any government service. An intentional CX strategy is essential to building and maintaining public trust, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of government programs, and delivering better outcomes for the public. 

By focusing on the customer's needs and expectations, federal agencies can create more user-friendly and efficient processes, provide more timely and helpful support, and deliver better experiences. This can lead to increased public satisfaction, greater trust in government, and improved outcomes for all."
