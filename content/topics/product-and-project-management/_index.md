deck: "Strong product and project management steer federal agencies to successful service delivery."

summary: "Effective product and project management practices are cornerstones of success for federal agencies. They streamline resource allocation, mitigate risks, and ensure impactful delivery of essential digital services. 

Product management, as distinct from project management,  guides the vision and direction of a product or deliverable, prioritizing user needs and outcomes while mitigating risk. 

Project management, meanwhile, orchestrates the execution of plans, controls scope, schedule, and budget. It fosters stakeholder engagement, transparency, and accountability, ensuring projects stay on track and deliver tangible value. 

This duo equips agencies to solve complex challenges, optimize resource utilization, and ultimately fulfill their mandates to serve the public."
