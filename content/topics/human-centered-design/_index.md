# Topic Title
title: "Human centered design"
deck: "Take the guesswork out of service design by understanding people's needs."

summary: "Human centered design (HCD) is a philosophy and method that places peopleâ€™s experiences at the heart of service design. Unlike traditional, system-centric approaches, HCD prioritizes understanding real-world challenges and frustrations faced by users and crafting solutions that directly address them. HCD is a continuous process, not a one-time fix. Regular evaluation and user feedback are essential to maintain relevance and adapt services to evolving user needs. HCD provides a valuable framework for ensuring government services are and remain accessible, efficient, and user-centric."
