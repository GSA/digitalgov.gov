deck: "Use podcasts to offer pre-recorded content your users can listen to anytime, anywhere."

summary: "Podcasts enable government agencies to connect with the public in a fresh, accessible way. More informal than press releases, podcasts can offer digestible insights into government work. For example, consider demystifying complex policies through engaging interviews, humanizing experts through storytelling, and addressing public concerns in candid conversations. 

Use podcasts to foster transparency, build trust, and inject a bit of humanity into the public’s perception of government."
