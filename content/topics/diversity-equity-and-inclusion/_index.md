# Topic Title
title: "Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion"
deck: "Find out how to incorporate diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) into digital experiences."
summary: "When digital experiences are designed to be inclusive, they are accessible to all — people with diverse abilities, people who speak different languages, and people from diverse cultural, ethnic, and economic backgrounds. Inclusion creates a better user experience for everyone. When we consider inclusion from the start of designing digital experiences, we create a wider impact for the products and services we design."
