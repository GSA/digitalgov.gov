title: Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
summary: When digital experiences are designed to be inclusive, they are
  accessible to all â€” people with diverse abilities, people who speak different
  languages, and people from diverse cultural, ethnic, and economic backgrounds.
  Inclusion creates a better user experience for everyone. When we consider
  inclusion from the start of designing digital experiences, we create a wider
  impact for the products and services we design.
