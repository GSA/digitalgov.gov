In today’s environment, federal teams are continually improving and transforming digital services. Teams and organizations are becoming more agile over time, learning new processes, techniques, and skills that allow them to implement digital services faster and more iteratively. Adapting to calls for a better customer experience, increased accessibility for all, and a more agile approach requires change — technical change, culture change, and more. 

Join this event to learn more about digital services and transformation and hear from a cross-agency panel about how they are approaching organizational culture and change. We’ll answer questions like: 

* Why is culture important?
* What cultural changes are needed to modernize digital services?
* How and when should we use change management?
* What are the outcomes? How do you measure success?
* What are some practical steps to get started?
* How can we modernize user experience research?
* What is the biggest challenge in building high-performing digital teams?
* How do you engage with stakeholders throughout the process?

**We’ll kick off the event with a panel discussion moderated by Marisa Levine, Presidential Innovation Fellows director of events and community partnerships, followed by Q&A.**
