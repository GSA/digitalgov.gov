These days, federal job postings for writers, editors, and many other positions either request or require plain language experience—skills, former training, or even some level of expertise called “mastery.” You may have been toiling away for years to change wordy or obscure bureaucratese, governmentese, legalese, or similar styles into clear and beautiful plain language. Short of becoming a trainer yourself, how do you position yourself as a plain language pro?  How do you create your own personal plain language brand?

In this session, Katherine Spivey and Wendy Wagner-Smith will cover: 

* How to establish a personal plain language “brand.”
* How to advance your brand whether you are introverted or extroverted, and let the Internet do most of the work for you.
* How to plan your career for your long-term future as a plain language pro.
