Join the U.S. Web Design System team as we look at what’s in USWDS 2.11.0, our most recent release. We’ll review the latest bundle of components designed with emergency response in mind — icon list component, modal component, sortable tables, 404 page template, link guidance, and print style guidance. We’ll also explain how you can use them to highlight critical information and actions on your websites during emergency response efforts for COVID-19, hurricanes, and other critical incidents. 

The information in this month’s call will be beneficial for developers.

This event is part of a monthly series that takes place on the third Thursday of each month. We post the video on Digital.gov shortly after each event. Don’t forget to set a placeholder on your personal calendar for our future events this year.
