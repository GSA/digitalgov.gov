Have you ever wondered whether people will be able to understand and use your letters, notices, fact sheets, or other documents? Usability testing isn't only for websites. Come work with Dr. Ginny Redish and learn three techniques for quick and easy ways to test documents' usability: paraphrase, plus/minus, and task-based.

Use these techniques to avoid the problems and costs of confused readers, turned-off readers, too many phone calls, and even more serious consequences for both your audiences and your agency.

At the end of this 90-minute webinar with demonstrations, you will be able to

* test documents with each of three techniques;
* know that you can use these techniques in person, with remote in person technology, and by phone; and
* choose which technique is right for your situation and adapt it to your needs.

## Presenter:

* **[Dr. Janice (Ginny) Redish](https://digital.gov/authors/ginny-redish/)**, Plain Language expert and author.
