Join Dan Williams and the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) team to learn more about the high-level system benefits of design systems, including USWDS. They will take a look at the design system’s core value and benefits, and answer these questions: 

* Why choose USWDS over other frameworks?
* What value does it bring to your agency?
* How can it help you build trust while furthering your unique mission?

The information in this month’s call will be beneficial for web managers and team leads that might be looking to implement USWDS and want to understand the return on investment (ROI) and overall benefits of this particular framework.

This event is part of a monthly series that takes place on the third Thursday of each month. We post the video on Digital.gov shortly after each event. Don’t forget to set a placeholder on your personal calendar for our future events this year.
