In the second part of our Analytics Case Study series, we'll address how to report and conduct analysis through the lens of your analytics strategy. We'll be using both the [Digital AnalyticsProgram](https://digital.gov/guides/dap/) (DAP) analytics account as well as FedRAMP's team-managed analytics account to illustrate essential concepts.

The goal of this webinar is to empower you with a real-world example about how to tie your metrics to your website mission, goals, and key performance indicators (KPIs). We will be joined by members of the [Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program](https://www.fedramp.gov/) (FedRAMP) team to hear their thoughts on their analytics strategy, pulling reporting, and how they plan to use the data to make future decisions about their site, fedramp.gov.
