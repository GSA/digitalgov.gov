This webinar is to introduce the [Innovation Adoption Community of Practice](https://digital.gov/communities/innovation-adoption/) (CoP), its upcoming Innovation Adoption Playbook, and the shared vision for this community. Learn how the playbook’s six plays can help you adopt and practice innovative approaches within your agency.

* Play 1: Everyone can build a better government
* Play 2: Keep your user at the center of your design
* Play 3: Embrace change and experiment
* Play 4: Collaborate with partners
* Play 5: Let data inform your decision making
* Play 6: Innovation is not a one-size-fits-all approach
