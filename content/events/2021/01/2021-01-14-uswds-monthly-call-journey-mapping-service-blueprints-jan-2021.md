It's a new year, a new administration, and as good a time as any to revisit the design principles that guide our work. On Thursday, January 21, join the U.S. Web Design System team to learn how journey maps and service blueprints help teams better understand how people really use our sites and services to do what they need to do—across interactions, and even across services. We hope you’ll leave the call with a fresh perspective on promoting continuity and starting with real user needs. This month's call should be of particular interest to anyone interested in user experience, customer experience, and the design decision-making process.

This event is part of a monthly series that takes place on the third Thursday of each month. We post the video on Digital.gov shortly after each event. Don’t forget to set a placeholder on your personal calendar for our future events this year.
