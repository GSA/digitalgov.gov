### Hazard Simplification: The Transition to Plain Language (1:30 pm - 2:00 pm, ET)

This presentation will focus on one of the key outcomes of the National Weather Service's (NWS) Hazard Simplification project. In March 2020, the NWS announced the decision to remove the “Advisory” headline term from its Watch, Warning and Advisory (WWA) system no earlier than 2024. Years of social science research and engagement confirmed that a large majority of the public, and some partners, misunderstand the term “Advisory.” In place of “Advisory," the NEWS will use plain language headlines to clearly describe the hazard and expected impact. NWS continues to engage with its partners on education, outreach, and technical needs to ensure a successful and smooth transition.

In this session you will hear from the following speakers:

* **Danielle Nagele** — National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)

### Getting GAO’s Message Across in the Digital Age (2:15 pm - 3:00 pm, ET)

GAO provides Congress, the heads of executive agencies, and the public with timely, fact-based, nonpartisan information. GAO’s work improves government and saves taxpayers billions of dollars, but reading a GAO report takes a lot of time—something today’s busy readers are short on. So, in 2016, to increase readability and understanding of its work, GAO started publishing Fast Facts with each report. Fast Facts are online introductions that use clear, direct language and a simple visual element to convey the most important information about the report to readers. With the addition of Fast Facts, readers spent 70% longer on GAO.gov—and that number skyrocketed to nearly 700% longer for people on mobile devices.

In this session you will hear from the following speakers:

* **Eden Savino** — Government Accountability Office (GAO)
* **Melanie Fallow** — Government Accountability Office (GAO)
