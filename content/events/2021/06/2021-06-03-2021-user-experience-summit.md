## Engaging Employees: A Critical Step To Improving the Customer Experience (CX) (1:45 pm - 2: 45 pm, ET)

Improving the customer experience (CX) starts with improving the employee experience. Leaders that actively empower and engage their employees know that they alone can’t holistically improve their customers’ experiences. They understand that it’s critical for their employees to feel valued and engaged in order for them to want to provide outstanding service and create positive customer experiences. Learn how one government agency discovered the vital behaviors that lead to engaged employees and replicate it at your agency.

## Humanizing Data and Success Metrics (3:00 pm - 4: 00 pm, ET)

UX practitioners value data and evidence. But who determines 1) what data matters, 2) whether decisions should be co-created and shared with frontline teams and the public, and 3) how data practices perpetuate, or don’t perpetuate, structural inequalities? Join us for lessons learned from projects that tried to answer these questions.

## Equity-Centered Design: Challenges in Government (11:00 am - 12:00 pm, ET)

18F’s research practice is evolving from user-centered design toward equity-centered design, an approach that addresses power imbalances between researchers and participants. Equity-centered design seeks to provide value back to participants. It provides mechanisms to identify potential hazards and harms in the services and products we create. Prioritizing equity can result in safer, more equitable access to government services for everyone, including those in marginalized groups. In this session we’ll share our vision of a more equitable 18F research practice, how we’re overcoming government-specific hurdles to engage in better collaboration with research participants and communities, and tips you can incorporate into your practice.

## Building Empathy Remotely (12:30 pm - 12:50 pm, ET)

Remote design research presents a myriad of challenges, and one of the more abstract challenges is how to create empathy with participants. Through the lens of a COVID-19 response tablet distribution program that provided internet access, we explored the creative ways we tried to build empathy with our research participants, and create a shared headspace as a team. Despite only speaking with participants over the phone, we were able to imagine the ways they incorporated their tablets into their daily lives through their stories which left us listening to brand new music and exploring new-to-us android games.

In this session you will hear from the following speakers:

* **Alexander Hoover** &mdash; U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
* **Elyse Voegeli** &mdash; New York City Mayor's Office of the Chief Technology Officer

## Pivot on a Deadline: How To Use More Testing, Not Less, To Drive Delivery (12:50 pm - 1:10 pm, ET)

When user research and usability face tightening deadlines, deadlines usually win and testing is the first thing to be dropped from the schedule. The result is often something that meets requirements and the launch date, but not user needs. In this lightning talk, we’ll use the example of the [Annual Student Loan Acknowledgement](https://www.studentaid.gov/asla/) to discuss how to keep user research and usability testing central in even the tightest development cycles. Rather than fighting deadlines, use testing to prioritize, divide across releases, and ensure your minimum viable product (MVP) is not just viable, but valuable.

## Discovery Research for Government Application Programming Interfaces (APIs): Why and How (1:10 pm - 1:30 pm, ET)

Why invest in discovery research to design APIs for government services? What methods to use and what questions to ask? This presentation will share learnings from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) API platform, [VA Lighthouse APIs](https://developer.va.gov/). We conduct discovery research to design API functionality that enables Veterans to apply for and appeal benefits. In line with a human-centered design approach to APIs, we use an ethnography framework to approach problems from the perspective of the people who use and manage these benefits, and make sure we’re designing APIs that answer Veterans’ questions and address their needs.

## Conscious Uncoupling: Innovative Ways To Separate User Habits From User Needs (11:00 am - 12:00 pm, ET)

We all do things out of habit, whether it’s thawing chicken in the microwave or instinctively clicking the farthest right button to submit a form. But what happens when your users don’t understand why they’re doing things a certain way, when behavior is so ingrained that they can’t differentiate the what from the why? At the U.S. Tax Court, we encountered such habitual thinking while modernizing a decades-old legacy system, where behaviors were unwittingly shaped by technical limitations, systematic training issues, and “that’s just how it is” thinking. We'll share creative ways to get to the root of behavior and uncover what users really need.

## Patient-Powered Innovations: Framing Problems Into Opportunities With Health+ (12:30 pm - 12:50 pm, ET)

As designers and technologists in government, how can we put the American people first, listening and learning from them every step of the way? In this talk, you'll hear about how the [Health+](https://www.hhs.gov/cto/initiatives/digital-services/health-plus/index.html) methodology at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) facilitates patient-centered innovations as part of the [LymeX](https://www.hhs.gov/cto/initiatives/innovation-and-partnerships/lyme-innovation/lymex/index.html) public-private partnership. You'll learn about the playbook we've created to frame problems effectively, starting first and foremost with your stakeholders that are experts in their lived experiences. You'll also learn about how to apply these human-centered design methods in your own projects.

In this session you will hear from the following speaker:

* **Alex Wilson** &mdash; HHS

## Overturning Precedent, Applying Human-Centered Design to Legal Matters (12:50 pm - 1:10 pm, ET)

Designers across government must build rapport with subject matter experts (SMEs) in economics, policy, and other fields who often bring an analytical approach that clashes with the creative methods of design. How do we build bridges across disciplines? This case study will share insights on the application of a human-centered design approach to the [Equal Employment Opportunity process at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/office-civil-rights/eeo-policy-and-reports/) (CFPB). Learn about ways to develop frameworks for co-creation with SMEs, navigating differences between legalese, service design, and plain language, as well as how to move from procedural actions to intentional interactions.

## Iterating on a State-Level Digital Service Team: Colorado's Year One Self-Retro (1:45 pm - 2:45 pm, ET)

State-level digital service teams are still a relatively new entity in the civic tech space. As our Colorado Digital Service team passed our one year anniversary, we wanted to understand: What value did we bring to our agency partners? How did our self-perceived value differ from how our partners saw us? How can we iterate upon our team to help build a more equitable state government for all Coloradans? We conducted a self-retro by interviewing 40+ state government employees who had interacted with us over the past year, and compared that input against our own team’s value statements. The results were illuminating. Learn about what we did well and what we could have done better.

## You’re a Human-Centered Designer! Trust Me! (3:00 pm - 4:00 pm, ET)

Human-centered design is critical to the success of building modern services. Especially in government, we should build services for people but also with the people - but also _with_ the people. But how do you build human-centered products that meet people’s needs without the resources for a dedicated human centered design person? In this presentation, we’ll demonstrate that folks with UX in their title don’t have a monopoly on human centered design methods. Learn about our experience as a team of federal staff who use human centered design methods at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to improve healthcare delivery and care coordination for medicare beneficiaries.
