[View the slides](https://designsystem.digital.gov/files/monthly-calls/uswds-monthly-call-june-2021-distro.pptx) (PPT, 4.82 MB, 37 pages)

Join Dan Williams and the design system team for a close look at a new component: pagination. We invite you to learn more about what pagination is, why and how we built it, what problems it solves, and why it’s important. 

We will give an overview of the background of this component (user experience research and testing), design considerations, guidance (when to use and when not to use), and then offer a demonstration to show you how it could work on your website. We will also offer use-cases and more, plus host a Q&A session with all attendees! 

*This event is part of a monthly series that takes place on the third Thursday of each month. We post the video on Digital.gov shortly after each event. Don’t forget to set a placeholder on your personal calendar for our future events this year.*
