For millions of Americans, access to government information and services isn’t a luxury — it’s critical. And now, more than ever, their experiences using contact centers, websites, and other channels to find unemployment support, file taxes, apply for student loans, or get assistance with housing, childcare, or food can dramatically affect how they feel about the government.

While there are many things we can do to improve their experience, chatbots are a must-have in our customer experience strategy. 

Join this event, hosted by the Web Content Managers Community, to learn more about chatbots and hear from a cross-agency panel about how they have used chatbots and other virtual assistants to improve customer experience.

We’ll kick off the event with a live demo of an agency’s chatbot followed by a panel discussion and Q&A.
