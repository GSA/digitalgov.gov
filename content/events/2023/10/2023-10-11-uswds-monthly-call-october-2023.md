One of our roadmap goals is to conduct more user research with people with disabilities — and to ensure we’re doing so regularly. 

Over the last few months, we've made a lot of progress. This month we'll share our progress and report on findings from our first round of this research: conducting usability tests on [Design System components](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/overview/) focused on users with visual impairments.

We’ll discuss:

* How we're working with GSA’s [10x program](https://10x.gsa.gov/) to develop a sustainable, repeatable research process
* Steps to operationalize research with people with disabilities
* Our work to recruit users of assistive technology to participate in user research
* Our usability testing process
* Findings from our recent usability testing
* Where we go from here 

**This event is best suited for:** Anyone who uses the U.S. Web Design System. This event will have an accessibility and usability focus.
