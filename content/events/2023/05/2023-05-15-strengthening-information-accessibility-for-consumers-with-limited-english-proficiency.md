Join us for a webinar with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) team to discuss the new work they are doing to increase language access on ConsumerFinance.gov.

Experiencing a financial challenge can be daunting, and it can be even more overwhelming when critical financial information is not in your primary language. Financial issues can have a significant impact on people's lives, and it is crucial to have access to information that can help them navigate these challenges effectively.

We will hear from the CFPB team about their work to ensure meaningful access to individuals with limited English proficiency.

This event is best suited for all levels of multilingual practitioners. Those who work in related fields such as plain language, communications, customer experience, user experience and web management will also benefit from attending.
