In this month's meeting, the [Plain Language Action and Information Network (PLAIN)](https://www.digitalgov.gov/communities/plain-language-community-of-practice/) co-chairs will provide a recap of international plain language initiatives discussed at the 2017 Plain Language Association International conference in Graz, Austria.

The second Wednesday of every month, PLAIN hosts a monthly meeting from 2-3 p.m. Hosted by DigitalGov, the meetings are recorded and posted to [DigitalGov's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/digitalgov).

In addition to addressing timely topics, like science communications and health literacy, typical discussions include: plain language training; hands-on editing exercises; how to write for web and social media; and content strategy.
