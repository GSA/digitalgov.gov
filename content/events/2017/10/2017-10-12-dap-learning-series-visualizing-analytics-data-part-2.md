## About the training

In [Visualizing Analytics Data Part 1](https://youtu.be/HSJq7OTaF0Q), we showed you how to export data into spreadsheets tools, clean it, and use it for charts. In this online event, we’ll discuss how to use tools that are designed to import data and visualize it without report exports.

There are both paid and free tools where you can create dashboards with logos, color schemes, and adjustable formats of visualizations for your analytics data. You can even make them dynamic with date range pickers and embed the dashboards directly into HTML via iframes! We’ll show you how we visualize data and discuss some of the concepts you might keep in mind.

## What you’ll learn

- How to create a KPI dashboard
- How to style and size charts, editing font, color, placement, etc
- How to embed a dashboard you created into a web page
