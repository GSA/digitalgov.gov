title: 'Hands-On Workshop with Cloud.gov'
summary: 'The Cloud Application Platform for Compliance and Transformation

You want your agency’s move to cloud computing to deliver flexibility, cost-savings, and process improvement&#46; But the promise of those goals proves elusive with the challenges of Infrastructure-as-a-Service, contracting vehicles and compliance requirements&#46;

GSA’s cloud.gov is the high-performance Platform-as-a-Service by and for the federal government. Imagine a secure cloud environment where your team can get up and running in minutes, then build, manage, and release applications with a radically shortened path to achieving Authority to Operate from your agency&#46; By practicing DevSecOps with cloud&#46;gov, you and your team can deliver at the “speed of mission&#46;”

In this workshop we’ll contrast building, delivering and securing web applications in cloud&#46;gov to a typical infrastructure-as-a-service approach&#46; In the hands-on portion you’ll walk through the steps to launch a live web application, fully demonstrating the power of cloud&#46;gov’s PaaS approach&#46;

Featured Speaker

Peter Burkholder joined 18F as a DevOps engineer in August 2016 after guiding private enterprises in DevOps adoption with Chef Software, and providing web operations for AARP, National Institutes of Health, National Center for Atmospheric Research, and several startups&#46;
