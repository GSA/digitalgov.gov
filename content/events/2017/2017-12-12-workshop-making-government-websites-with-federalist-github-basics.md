Come learn more about how to create a simple, compliant government website, using Federalist, GitHub and the U.S. Web Design Standards.

This workshop will provide you and your team with an overview of using TTS’s new government-specific tools in combination with GitHub. Then we’ll show you how, together, they make it easier than ever to create and launch compliant, government websites. 

The second part of the workshop is your chance to get hands-on experience with these tools. We are designing three breakout sessions aimed at helping those on your team publish on Federalist by the end of the day.
