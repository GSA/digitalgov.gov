Come learn how to create a simple, compliant government website using [GitHub](https://www.github.com/), [Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov/), and the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov/).

This workshop will provide you and your team with an overview of using two new government-specific tools from the Technology Transformation Service (TTS) with GitHub. Then we’ll show you how, together, they make it easier than ever to create and launch compliant government websites.

The second part of the workshop will be your chance to get hands-on experience with these tools. We are designing three breakout sessions aimed at helping those on your team publish on Federalist by the end of the day.

:sparkles: _We will live-stream the first 90 mins of the workshop. Video will be available after._ :sparkles:
