We'll discuss your formal and informal plain language work (teaching, training, reviewing, or copyediting) and how to best document and publicize it so you can get credit for the work you’re doing.

**Questions we’ll  address:**

- How do I get credit for the Plain Language work I’m already doing?
- How should I best promote the Plain Language work I’m doing?
- What Plain Language opportunities are out there?
- How to best share your work on LinkedIn, your performance plan, your IDP, and your performance review?

**Here's our panel:**

- Donna Garland, Deputy Associate Administrator for Communication, General Services Administration
- Megan Miller, plain language writer/editor, Patent and Trademark Office
- Jonathan Withington, Chief, Plain Language Division, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services

Please submit your questions to [info@plainlanguage.gov](mailto:info@plainlanguage.gov) by Tuesday, March 12 with the subject line: `3/13 Career Advice Meeting`.
