This month, we'll be giving you all an overview of multiple Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools followed by a deep-dive on how to setup a Gitlab Runner to perform GitOps functions including IaC deployments against multiple AWS environments. We will also have a demo of the National Geospatial Technical Operation Center (NGTOC) approach at using best practices for rapid development and continuous deployment of immutable infrastructure(s).

## Our speaker

**Robert Djurasaj** is the Cloud Architect (on detail) and Delivery Project Manager at NGTOC in Denver. There he is managing a team responsible for serving geospatial data and services to both public and internal users. He has been a leader in the Center and in USGS in transitioning from an on-premise to a cloud-based IT architecture. Currently, he is working closely with NGTOC teams to enhance and promote the use of AWS cloud.

## What is DevOps?
**DevOps** is a set of software development practices that combine software development (Dev) and information-technology operations (Ops) to 1) shorten the systems-development life cycle, while 2) delivering features, fixes, and updates that align with an organization’s goals and objectives.

DevOps is as much about culture as it is about the process. Initiatives can create challenging but important cultural change enterprise-wide that transforms how developers, operations, and software testers collaborate during development, delivery, and management processes.
