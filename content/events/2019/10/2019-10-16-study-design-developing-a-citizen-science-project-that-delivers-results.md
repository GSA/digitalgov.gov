Developing a citizen science project can be an effective means of collecting data and reaching diverse audiences, while providing education on how to use science to understand our world. It can also be an opportunity to engage local communities and volunteers in collecting data that can lead to results in understanding, protecting, and restoring local environments. Prior to developing a community-based data collection program, it is essential to think through the scientific process and the steps necessary to create a program where the data collected match your monitoring objectives. The study design process facilitates the essential decisions that need to be made. This 60-minute session will explore the fundamental building blocks for building a strong citizen science program.
