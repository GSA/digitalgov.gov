Developing a citizen science project can be an effective means of collecting data and reaching diverse audiences, while providing education on how to use science to understand our world. It can also be an opportunity to engage local communities and volunteers in collecting data that can lead to results in understanding, protecting, and restoring local environments. Prior to developing a community-based data collection program, it is essential to think through the scientific process and the steps necessary to create a program where the data collected match your monitoring objectives. The study design process facilitates the essential decisions that need to be made. This 60-minute session will explore the fundamental building blocks for building a strong citizen science program.

***Julie Vastine*** is the director of the Alliance for Aquatic Resource Monitoring (ALLARM) at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.  She is responsible for leadership of the ALLARM program and providing technical assistance to watershed communities interested in using science as a tool for change.  Julie has worked in the volunteer monitoring/citizen science field for seventeen years. In 2019, she was appointed to the National Water Quality Monitoring Council as the volunteer monitoring representative. In 2018, she was elected to the Citizen Science Association. A native of the Chesapeake Bay region, Julie enjoys working with community organizations to build their capacity to monitor, protect, and restore water quality in Pennsylvania and New York. In addition to her love working with communities on stream monitoring, Julie enjoys hiking, biking, cooking, and yoga.
