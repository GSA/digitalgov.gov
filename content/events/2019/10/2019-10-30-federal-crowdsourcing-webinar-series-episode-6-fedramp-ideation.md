Government is finding its way to the cloud, using care and caution to protect its sensitive data while supporting current IT modernization efforts, a hallmark of the [President’s Management Agenda](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/pma/) (PMA).

Enter the [Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program](https://www.fedramp.gov) (FedRAMP). Based within the [U.S. General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov) (GSA), FedRAMP has been helping federal agencies navigate this path since 2011. The program offers a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring, and has cultivated a marketplace of FedRAMP authorized cloud service providers to support the needs of agencies.

Although agencies are adopting cloud technologies at record-high levels, challenges remain within the FedRAMP process and across the [Federal Information Security Management Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2521) (FISMA) and [Risk Management Framework](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-37/rev-2/final) (RMF). In an effort to enhance and evolve the program, the FedRAMP team asked the public for bold, innovative and actionable ideas that could improve and benefit the authorization process.

[**Betsy Steele**](https://digital.gov/authors/bsteele/) leads the FedRAMP Program Office’s outreach and training initiatives. In her role, she develops and implements training for agencies, cloud service providers, and third-party assessment organizations to increase the rate of cloud adoption and the security of cloud computing solutions used across government. Prior to joining FedRAMP, Betsy managed GSA’s government-wide Terms of Service Program, negotiating more than 70 federal compatible terms of service amendments for social media tools and applications.

**More About the Series**

This is the sixth episode in the Federal Crowdsourcing Webinar Series, which typically airs the second Tuesday of each month. With each installment, we illuminate how U.S. agencies are reaching beyond their walls to source talent and enthusiasm, and can multiply the ideas and perspectives being brought to a particular issue.
