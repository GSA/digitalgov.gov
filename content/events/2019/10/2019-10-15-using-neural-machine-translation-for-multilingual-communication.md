A new type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, called Neural Machine Translation (NMT), is quickly earning the attention of multilingual communities. This software is helping to expedite the translation process and has the potential to open government information to more non-English languages. 

In this session, Beth Flaherty will give a high-level overview of machine translation technology. We will discuss the evolution of machine translation (MT), how MT is used in the government, ways to “specialize” a language engine to a specific domain, calculation of return on investment (ROI), and the road ahead.  We’ll also show a live demo of the NMT software so that the audience can see the flexibility of use with this technology.

**Beth Flaherty** is SYSTRAN Software’s Director of Government Solutions and is based in the Washington D.C. area. In her role, Beth is responsible for account management for current US Government clients and for educating prospective clients on the benefits of machine translation.

For 20+ years, Beth has led business development efforts and program execution teams for government language programs.  She understands the important relationship between language services and human language technology (HLT), having worked for companies such as Berlitz, Lionbridge, SAIC (Language Services), and SDL. She has actively participated in the Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) and AMTA - Government Track. Beth holds an MBA in International Business from The George Washington University, a BBA and Spanish minor from Saint Mary’s College (IN), and PMP Certification.
