David Lipscomb from the Center for Plain Language will discuss the documents they'll review and the criteria they'll use for grading in the upcoming Federal Plain Language Report Card. This meeting is also a chance for interested feds to ask questions and offer feedback on how to make the annual report card process more helpful in the coming years.
