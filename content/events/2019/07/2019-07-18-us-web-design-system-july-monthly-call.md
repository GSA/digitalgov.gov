The U.S. General Services Administration’s [Technology Transformation Services](https://www.gsa.gov/tts) (TTS) launched [U.S. Web Design System 2](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) on April 8, 2019. Please join Dan Williams, USWDS product lead, as he hosts special guests from across government as they share their experience with migrating to USWDS 2. Dan will also take any questions about the system you may have.

This event is part of a monthly series generally taking place the third Thursday of each month. Video from the webinar will be available on Digital.gov shortly after the event.

[**USWDS**](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) is a library of code, tools, and guidance to help government teams design and build fast, accessible, mobile-friendly government websites backed by user research and modern best practices. USWDS 2 is an important update to the design system — it introduces a powerful toolkit of new features to help make creating useful, consistent digital services faster, simpler, and more fun.

In addition, USWDS 2 ships with [**Public Sans**](https://public-sans.digital.gov/) — a free, open source typeface that’s simple, neutral, and isn’t Helvetica. Public Sans is an open source, free license typeface (SIL Open Font License 1.1) designed and maintained by USWDS, adapted from Libre Franklin.
