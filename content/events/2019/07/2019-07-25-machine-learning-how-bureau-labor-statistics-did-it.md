Come and learn about the eight year journey of integrating machine learning models into the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Discover how the organization learned to change, and how the team worked internally to make BLS more data-friendly.

Joining us will be presenter Alex Measure, Economist at Bureau of Labor Statistics. Alex is an economist turned machine learning and natural language processing practitioner. He designs, builds, and maintains machine learning systems that automate difficult text classification, information extraction, and record matching problems in production systems.
