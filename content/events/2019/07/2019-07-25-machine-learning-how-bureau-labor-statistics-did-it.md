Come and learn about the eight year journey of integrating machine learning (ML) models into the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/) (BLS). Discover how the organization learned to change, and how the team worked internally to make BLS more data-friendly.

Joining us will be presenter **Alex Measure**, an economist-turned-machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) practitioner at BLS. He designs, builds, and maintains machine learning systems that automate difficult text classification, information extraction, and record-matching problems in production systems.
