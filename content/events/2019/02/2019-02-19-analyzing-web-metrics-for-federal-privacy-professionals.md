_For this event, the [Digital Analytics Program](https://digital.gov/dap/) (DAP) has partnered with the fine folks who run the [Federal Privacy Council](https://www.fpc.gov/)'s Tech Tuesday Series to teach us how to measure, analyze, and improve experiences for users visiting privacy pages on your agency websites._

* Do you ever wonder how many visitors your agency's privacy website ([example](https://www.gsa.gov/reference/gsa-privacy-program)) gets, what they search for, how long they stay, and if they are mobile users?
* Does your Senior Agency Official for Privacy (or other agency officials) ask how well your privacy website and resources are serving your users?
* Have you considered whether you can create a better user experience for the public?

Join us to learn the answers to all those questions&mdash;and some of yours!

In this webinar, [Tim Lowden](https://digital.gov/authors/tlowden/), Program Manager for [DAP](https://digital.gov/dap/), will give a brief introduction of the initiative itself, and give you insight into how you can use the DAP Google Analytics account to view data about the privacy-related pages on your website.
