The Federal Crowdsourcing Webinar Series explores how federal agencies are engaging the crowd to multiply the ideas and perspectives they bring to certain issues. In this third episode, you’ll learn how The Opportunity Project is bringing together government, technologists, and communities to create digital tools that help strengthen economic opportunity.

Through [The Opportunity Project](https://opportunity.census.gov/), the U.S. Census Bureau connects tech developers, local leaders, and nonprofits to create digital solutions to problems faced by communities throughout the country. The results empower people with technology and make government data more accessible and user-friendly.

Since launching in 2016, The Opportunity Project has yielded dozens of new digital tools that, among other things, connect veterans and their families with jobs, increase access to services and shelter for people experiencing homelessness, and rebuild rural economies.

In this episode, The Opportunity Project Director Drew Zachary will provide:

- an overview of the project’s accomplishments to date,
- a primer on how different organizations and people can get involved, and
- Information on how it serves the broader crowdsourcing mission at Census Open Innovation Labs.

She’ll also preview an exciting new venture planned for the summer when The Opportunity Project launches its first-ever prize competition to encourage product adoption and sustainability.

**Upcoming episodes in the Federal Crowdsourcing Webinar Series include:**

- July 9: Open Opportunities, Office of Personnel Management
- August 13: History By the People, Library of Congress
