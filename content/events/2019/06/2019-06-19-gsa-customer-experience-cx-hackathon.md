{{< img src="gsa-hackathon-2019" >}}

The General Services Administration (GSA) is holding a coast-to-coast hackathon on Wednesday, June 19, 2019, aimed at bettering the customer experience (CX) of products in government.

Improving customer experience is a top priority throughout the federal government, as described in the [President’s Management Agenda](https://www.performance.gov/PMA/PMA.html). Customer experience can refer to the external customers and internal customers. This hackathon, we will be focusing on both. The participants will be including the newly-released [U.S. Web Design System 2.0](https://digital.gov/2019/04/08/introducing-uswds-2/) in their solutions.

Throughout this all-day hackathon, taking place simultaneously at eight GSA locations nationwide, participants will evaluate real-world products and iterate on ideas for making the customer experience better in GSA applications.

## What Is Customer Experience, and What Does This Mean for Government?

Customer experience is the journey a customer has while interacting with products and brands. CX has gained a lot of attention within government, and our aim is to better the customer experience for external and internal interaction with government agencies, products, technology and people.

## What We’ll Be Hacking On

Participants will be hacking on applications that are core to GSA operations. Your ideas will help these services to have a greater impact in government.

## Cash Awards

GSA anticipates awarding four cash prizes, for a $20,000 total prize purse: four application-specific teams will be selected in the first round of judging to be eligible for a cash prize of $2,500 and move onto Round 2 judging. Of those, one solution will then be selected in Round 2 judging, and a $10,000 grand prize will be awarded that team, for a total of $12,500. Team application projects will be evaluated in accordance with the judging criteria outlined below.

Prizes will be distributed to the eligible winners via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), within 60 business days of the announcement of the winner(s). GSA will distribute the funds evenly to all team members listed in the original registrations who arrive at the Security Desk at their respective locations for the competition start time of 10:00am ET and stay for the full day (10:00 am - 4:00 pm, ET). Funding for this hackathon will come from GSA.

## How Judging Works

**Round 1** — Each team will have an equitable amount of time to present their solutions to a judging panel of 3 to 4 federal employees and the other teams until all teams have presented. After Round 1 judging is complete and winners are announced, the winners of Round 1 will move on to Round 2 judging.

**Round 2** — During Round 2, one winner will be selected by a federal executive judging panel and announced at 5:00 pm, ET.

All presentations and judging will take place virtually through video conferencing software and equipment provided by GSA, and in-person at 1800 F St NW, Washington, DC 20405.

Registered participants at the eight GSA locations nationwide will be evaluated equitably and there will be no advantage given to participants who are in-person at 1800 F St NW, Washington, DC 20405 .

### Presentations

Each team will present to a judging panel their solution for up to three minutes. In Round 1, each pool of competitors will only present and be judged against the same problem set. The judges will be evaluating each solution as if they are the application user. The round will be judged based on the following criteria with each judge independently scoring the solution on a scale of 1 to 5; for more information, please see the [Round 1 Judging Form](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/open?id=10BjnvPjGnflCrckbCJv6YKzBqPmZtLY650NMLGxElUU).

## Scoring

The judges’ scores will then be calculated into a weighted percentage as detailed below. The highest scoring solution in each problem set will be the winner.

### Usability — 45 percent

All instructions and text are in plain language and written in terms that all customers can understand.

- It’s clear to the customer where to go to accomplish the task.
- It’s easy to find help when the customer needs it.
- The customer can accomplish the task independently.
- The customer can accomplish the task efficiently.
- The customer isn’t distracted by the layout of the environment or application.
- The new additions to the application follows the new [U.S. Web Design System](https://digital.gov/2019/04/08/introducing-uswds-2/) 2.0, to the extent feasible.

### Emotional Response — 40 percent

- The customer looks forward to completing a task in this environment or application.
- The interaction makes the customer feel valued.
- The customer feels supported when they need help.
- The customer’s experience is seamless when moving between systems, people, and other touchpoints.

### Two-Way Feedback — 15 percent

- Customers know the status of their task.
- Customers can give feedback on their experience.
- Customers can see the impact of their feedback.
- Customers are informed about what’s been done with their feedback.

The four application winners will then move onto Round 2 judging. Round 2 judging will consist of 3 federal employee judges and will be conducted virtually using GSA-provided videoconferencing software and in-person at 1800 F St NW, Washington, DC 20405. Registered participants at all eight GSA locations nationwide will be treated equitably and there will be no advantage given to participants who are in-person at 1800 F St NW, Washington, DC 20405. Each team will be presenting their solution to a judging panel for up to five minutes.

In Round 2 judging, the pool of competition will be the four application-specific winners from Round 1 judging. The judges will be evaluating each solution as if they are the application user. The round will be judged based on the following criteria with each judge independently scoring the solution on a scale of 1 to 5; for more information, please see the [Round 2 Judging Form](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/open?id=1zZjIJRqoUryxZGj62wdsDlvymV2DBR9GMNzjDjxI1Q4).
