Cheryl Abram, Lead Evaluation for OPM’s Federal Executive Institute (FEI), will be discussing how to assess, achieve, and demonstrate Executive Core Qualifications. This seminar is open to all government employees with a .gov or .mil address.
  
The Federal Leadership and Professional Development Seminar Series provides no-cost “by government, for government” seminars that are presented by federal experts to employees across the government to share federal leader expertise and lessons learned; provide free training, as training resources are always limited; and bring individuals together from across the federal government and foster intra- and inter-agency connections, collaborations, and sharing.

To receive seminar invitations and resources, you may join the seminar series listserv by sending a blank email from your government email address to [FedLeadershipSeminar-subscribe-request@listserv.gsa.gov](mailto:FedLeadershipSeminar-subscribe-request@listserv.gsa.gov). Past leadership seminar recordings [are available on the FLPDSS YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ1wh1JcX9nwin7w1f_S3fQ).

For more information, please contact the FLPDSS Chair, Kim Wittenberg, via email at [kim.wittenberg@ahrq.hhs.gov](mailto:kim.wittenberg@ahrq.hhs.gov).
