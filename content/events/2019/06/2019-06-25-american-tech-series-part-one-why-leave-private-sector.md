**Why Leave the Private Sector?** Civic technologists bring new technologies into our government in service of the American people. Their job is about managing the process of technology change, and introducing the art of the possible to government leaders. Joining Davar Ardalan on American Tech are Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF) Executive Director, Joshua Di Frances, Director of Workforce Solutions at Centers of Excellence (CoE), Nina Bianchi, and PIF Clarice Chan who is now working with Veterans Affairs’ Chief Technology Officer (CTO).

Together with [Technology Transformation Services](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services) (TTS), we are launching this series in conjunction with GSA’s 70th Anniversary. Curated by TTS’s [Office of Products and Programs](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services/office-of-products-and-programs) (OPP), the [Presidential Innovation Fellows Program](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/federal-acquisition-service/technology-transformation-services/office-of-presidential-innovation-fellows) (PIF), and [DigitalGov University](https://digital.gov/digitalgov-university/) (DGU), these chats foster learnings and a collective voice on applied innovation. The series is produced and hosted by PIF leaders, Davar Ardalan and Joshua Di Frances.
