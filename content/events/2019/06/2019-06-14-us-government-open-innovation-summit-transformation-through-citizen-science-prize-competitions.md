On June 14, the General Services Administration and White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) hosted innovators from the public and private sectors to highlight the potential and impact of crowdsourcing through citizen science and prize competitions in the U.S. government.

The inaugural U.S. Open Innovation Summit featured a keynote speech from OSTP Director Dr. Kelvin Droegemeier, who announced the release of a new report on prize competitions and citizen science projects run by the federal government during 2017-2018.
The event featured a variety of presentations, panel discussions and interactive events that explored the use of these approaches, the opportunities and benefits they offer, and challenges integrating them into existing federal agency processes.
