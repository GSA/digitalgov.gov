On June 14, the General Services Administration (GSA) and White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) hosted innovators from the public and private sectors to highlight the potential and impact of crowdsourcing through citizen science and prize competitions in the U.S. government.

The inaugural U.S. Open Innovation Summit featured a keynote speech from OSTP Director Dr. Kelvin Droegemeier, who announced the release of a new report on prize competitions and citizen science projects run by the federal government from 2017 to 2018.
