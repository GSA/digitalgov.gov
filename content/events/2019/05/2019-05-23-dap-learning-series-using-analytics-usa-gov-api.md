Learn how [analytics.usa.gov](analytics.usa.gov), the public window into how the public interacts with federal government websites, uses an API and allows you to query data in machine-readable formats outside of the Google Analytics interface.

In this webinar, attendees will be introduced to the analytics.usa.gov API and how to query it for data.  Attendees will learn:

- How to get an API key
- What data is available via the API
- What filters one can use to narrow data
- Limitations of the data and/or API

Of note, this training is not a training specifically on APIs in general. The team will briefly cover what an API is and how they work, but it will not be an an-depth look at APIs themselves.
