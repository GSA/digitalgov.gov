Come learn more about how [Virtual Student Federal Service](https://www.state.gov/virtual-student-federal-service/) (VSFS) can help your program achieve its mission!

Now in its 10th year, the VSFS can connect your office to talented students across the country. VSFS is a free, shared service offering federal agencies an opportunity to engage directly and remotely with talented U.S. college students. These virtual interns can work on projects ranging from research to design to UX to data visualization to social media to translation to video production and more!

VSFS is the largest digital internship in the world that connects U.S. college students to the work of the federal government.

We hope you will join colleagues from over 50 federal agencies for the 2019-2020 program! Federal folks _(yes, you)_ can **submit projects between May 1 and June 10** on [vsfs.state.gov](https://vsfs.state.gov/how-to-apply) to request one or more U.S. college student virtual interns.

## What kind of projects are there?

Take your pick — from info graphic designer to data visualizer, app developer, digital diplomat, press and public outreach liaison, to environmental researcher, local tutor, translator, social media specialist, blogger and more. The virtual world is at your fingertips. No matter how you look at it, VSFS is a great opportunity for students looking to intern with the federal government.

This talk is hosted by the Digital.gov in support of the U.S. Department of State’s [Virtual Student Federal Service](https://www.state.gov/vsfs-a-great-opportunity-for-students-and-federal-employees-alike/) program.
