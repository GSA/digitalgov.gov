In February of this year traffic from mobile devices, as measured by GSA’s [Digital Analytics Program](https://analytics.usa.gov/), made up greater than 50 percent of web traffic for the first time in history.

What does it mean for federal agencies when most web traffic is coming from mobile devices? As for-profit brands increasingly compete for customers through better integrated digital experiences across platforms, how will the federal government meet the public’s ever-growing user expectations? What tools and resources are available to help federal practitioners transition towards a more holistic approach to customer experience? How is your agency working to improve the mobile citizen experience?

**David Fern**, the Mobile Community of Practice Manager, will host **Jacob Parcell**, Innovation Portfolio Director for the General Services Administration’s Technology Transformation Service, to discuss recent developments in mobile customer experience and highlight the opportunities for federal mobile practitioners in the months ahead.   

In addition, we will provide updates on the [Mobile Community of Practice]({{< link "communities/mobilegov.md" >}}), highlight current policy issues including the [21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act]({{< link "resources/connected-government-act.md" >}}

), and provide participants the opportunity to ask any questions that they might have.

This talk is hosted by the [Mobile Community of Practice]({{< link "communities/mobilegov.md" >}}) and [Digital.gov](https://digital.gov)
