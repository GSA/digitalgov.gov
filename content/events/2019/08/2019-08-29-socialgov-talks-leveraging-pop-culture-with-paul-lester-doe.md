Join Paul Lester, Digital Content Specialist for the [Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/) (DOE), to discuss how DOE leveraged the popular TV show, “Stranger Things” as a conversation starter about the agency’s mission and work using digital media (social media, blog, podcast, etc.). Mr. Lester will also discuss how he got management buy-in to use a pop culture phenomenon to promote the agency’s work.
