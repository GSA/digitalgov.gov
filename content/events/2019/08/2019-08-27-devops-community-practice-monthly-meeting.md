In October of 2018, a redesigned site for supporting the mission of Recreation.gov went into production. This new system was built from the ground up to provide the best user experience (UX) for anyone to safely and sustainably experience some of the United States' most prized national treasures. Reservations for campsites at Yosemite National Park, permits to climb half-dome, and tickets to attend the White House Easter Egg Hunt are just some of the items for sale. Recreation.gov is home to over 3,500 facilities and 100,000 campsites around the country.
 
In this talk, we will review the architecture of Recreation.gov and how it is operated to achieve its uptime goal&mdash;currently 99.9886 percent&mdash;for millions of yearly transactions. You can expect to learn how Recreation.gov is broken up into more than 40 microservices&mdash;all deployed to [Kubernetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes) clusters hosted in multiple Amazon Web Services (AWS) regions, using a continuous deployment model. Weâ€™ll also go over our top lessons learned on general microservice problems, and specific issues with operating any complex reservation system at scale.
