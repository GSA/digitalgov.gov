[---- COPY NEEDS TO BE UPDATED ----]

During this episode of the Federal Crowdsourcing Webinar Series, we met Lisa Nelson, engagement manager for the Open Opportunities program. She shared how agencies are crowdsourcing for talent to respond quickly to critical mission needs and changes, and how federal employees benefit from the experiential professional development offered.

Whether you’re looking to enhance existing skills, or seeking a more extensive career reboot without losing the benefits of your employment tenure, [Open Opportunities](https://openopps.usajobs.gov/) is a matchmaker made for government. The program, now part of [USAJOBS](https://www.usajobs.gov/), provides an avenue for federal workers to “try on” new assignments and positions, network both within and outside of their current agencies, and achieve professional development goals during short-term engagements.

Think of like a mini detail, but with less paperwork. Feds can volunteer up to 20% of their time—with a manager’s approval—to work on short-term assignments.

## In This Webinar, Learn How Open Opportunities Can Help...

- Advance your career by sharpening your skills or learning new ones.
- Break you from your routine, opening you to collaborations with others in different agencies.
- Expand your professional network and contacts within communities of innovators.
