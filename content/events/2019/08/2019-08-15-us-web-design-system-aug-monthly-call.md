Please join Dan Williams, USWDS product lead, for an introduction to bootstrapping USWDS, including how to add USWDS to a project and start designing in minutes. Dan will also answer your questions about the design system.

This event is part of a monthly series generally taking place the third Thursday of each month. Video from the webinar will be available on Digital.gov shortly after the event.

USWDS is a library of code, tools, and guidance to help government teams design and build fast, accessible, mobile-friendly government websites backed by user research and modern best practices. USWDS 2.0 is an important update to the design system — it introduces a powerful toolkit of new features to help make creating useful, consistent digital services faster, simpler, and more fun.
