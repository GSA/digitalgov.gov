Using external translation vendors can often be costly, rigid, and time-consuming. The [National Language Service Corps](https://www.nlscorps.org) (NLSC), a program of the [Defense Language National Security Education Office](https://dlnseo.org/) (DLNSEO) in the [Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness](https://prhome.defense.gov/) at the [Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov) (DoD), can help fulfill your language needs offering regional and cultural expertise at a fraction of the cost.

Hyejin Hickey and Christina Lantuh will share details of the NLSC—an agile, flexible, and cost-effective (yet high-quality) program that can provide services in over 400 languages. They will delve into the NLSC’s full range of language capabilities and answer your questions on how to maximize their services.

Within the past five years, she has supported the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, Office of Warrior Care, and the Defense Language and National Security Education Office’s National Language Service Corps.

**Hyejin Hickey** is a language acquisition professional with expertise in military foreign language education.
