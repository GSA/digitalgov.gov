Political Savvy can be defined as the ability to exhibit confidence and professional diplomacy, while effectively relating to people at all levels internally and externally. This seminar will focus on what it is, how to master it, and why mastering this skill is so important, along with a discussion about engagement and communications-related issues that are common across organizations. This talk is part of the Federal Leadership and Professional Development Seminar Series (FLPDSS).

## Our speaker

**Robert J. Huttenlocker** currently serves as the Assistant Inspector General for Management at the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). His USDA career spans almost 29 years, during which time he has held numerous leadership positions in three agencies and OIG. Mr. Huttenlocker has over 30 years of federal service and has been a member of the Senior Executive Service (SES) since November 2006. 

The Federal Leadership and Professional Development Seminar Series (FLPDSS) provides no-cost “by government, for government” seminars that are presented by federal experts to employees across the government to share federal leader expertise and lessons learned; provide free training, as training resources are always limited; and bring individuals together from across the federal government and foster intra- and inter-agency connections, collaborations, and sharing.
