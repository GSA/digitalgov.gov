This November, Dan Williams, [the U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) (USWDS) product lead, will demo the new version of the USWDS Jekyll theme.

We'll be joined by **Brian Seek**, a Drupalist and Engineer at CivicActions, working with the Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs. Brian Seek will talk about using Drupal to run multiple USWDS sites on the same codebase with different settings files.

This event is part of a monthly series that takes place on the third Thursday of each month. The video will be available on Digital.gov shortly after the event.

[**USWDS**](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) is a library of code, tools, and guidance to help government teams design and build fast, accessible, mobile-friendly government websites backed by user research and modern best practices.
