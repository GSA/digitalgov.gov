Join [IT Modernization Centers of Excellence] (https://coe.gsa.gov/) Director of Workforce Solutions, [Nina Bianchi] (https://digital.gov/authors/nina-bianchi/), in this two-hour in-person workshop to explore trends and barriers in the federal workforce transformation. You will learn insights identified from over 80 human-centered management workshops that Nina has led in the federal government since joining as a Presidential Innovation Fellow in September 2017. This workshop will be interactive and include collaborative human-centered brainstorming activities to help drive solutions that grow lifelong learning in the government. 

Let's imagine a future where the federal government is the employer of choice for the next generation of leaders. We’ll tackle some questions, such as: _How do we cultivate an environment of lifelong learning in the government where all stakeholders win?_, and _How might we foster learning cultures to meet evolving talent roles within the federal government?_ 

We’ll also examine various themes and topics, including:  

- the notion that transformation relies on a culture that embraces innovation; 
- that the adoption of emerging technology is made possible because ongoing learning is accessible and attractive; 
- and that a world-class government culture is achievable if it inspires employees at every level to focus on results, and it invests in continuous improvement to modernize agency operations.
