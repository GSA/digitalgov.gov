## About this session — Basics of Scrum, Part II

The second session on Scrum will go into more detail about what is happening during each of the Scrum ceremonies. Topics will include Sprint Planning, During the Sprint, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective, and Benefits of Scrum. We’ve tried to keep the prepared material a bit shorter to leave time for more questions and discussion.

## What is Agile?

If you take nothing else from all these words, take this — Agile is not a checklist, or a methodology, or a series of rituals. Agile is a way of thinking and a way of attacking problems. Embrace mistakes, learn, and keep trying. Mess up, and learn again and again and again. Cut your losses. Fail forward fast. It’s okay. You won’t get fired. You’re always improving.

As we put it in [the 18F Guide to Agile](https://agile.18f.gov/modern-software-product-development/) —  

> There are three basic approaches to software development: Waterfall, Agile, and Chaos.

> Chaos is when you don’t really have a methodology, and you don’t really learn anything, but everybody’s super busy all the time. Chaos is often characterized (or justified, if you want to be more critical) as “firefighting,” and it is suggested that there is no time to plan or learn because there is just so much to do.

> Waterfall is when you lay out The Plan in full before you start: every detail, every feature, every meeting, every benchmark, and then you’re wrong on most of them but forge ahead anyway, secure in the knowledge that following The Plan gives air cover in the likely event that the thing you’re building doesn’t work the way you expected it to when you made The Plan.

> Agile is different. In Agile, you build big things a baby step at a time. You are motivated and engaged because you are empowered to make your own decisions about how you accomplish your work. Agile has an end result in mind, and maybe a timeframe, but it only gets into the details as needed, which allows for change in response to new information.
