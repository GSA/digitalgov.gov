The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has been running A/B tests for over four years. We have learned a lot about when testing makes sense, how to work across teams for the best results, how to run a successful test, and what it means when your test doesn’t get the results you expected. In this session, we would like to share knowledge with our new community of practice, as well as discuss what we as a group hope to get out of this community.  

## Our Speaker and Community Manager

**Kelley Holden** is the Digital Analytics Program Manager at CFPB and works on the Data Science and Analytics team. She has worked on multiple projects including search engine optimization (SEO) strategy, A/B testing and randomized control trials (RCT), web analysis, analytics visualizations, data science, and user behavior analysis.
