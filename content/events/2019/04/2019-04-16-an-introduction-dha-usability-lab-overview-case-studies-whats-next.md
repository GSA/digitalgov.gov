Come learn about the [DHA Usability Lab](https://health.mil/About-MHS/OASDHA/Defense-Health-Agency/Operations/Clinical-Support-Division/Connected-Health/Usability-Lab) and how they are doing UX!

We’ll cover a range of topics, including an overview of the resources they provide—from cutting edge technologies to printed patient handouts. Find out how the Lab is evaluating current products and how they are improving the customer experience.

We’ll highlight several case studies and solutions for the unique challenges surrounding the expansion of usability in the military and how they are meeting these challenges. There will be time at the end for resource sharing and Q&A.
