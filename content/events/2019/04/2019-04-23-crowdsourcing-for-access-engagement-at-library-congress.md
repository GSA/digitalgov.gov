[Library of Congress Labs](https://labs.loc.gov/) will share its new crowdsourcing initiative, “[By the People](https://crowd.loc.gov),” which embodies the Library’s strategic goal of a user-centered library by actively engaging learners of all ages with digital historical collections.

By the People invites public participation in collective development of cultural memory through the exploration, transcription, and tagging of digitized collections to make digital collections more accessible. The user-centered project has a central goal of engaging the public where they are—physically, skill level, and knowledge—through trust and approachability. The project builds on skills and technologies of the Library of Congress and shares them back to the public through the underlying open source application, [Concordia](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/concordia). 

This presentation will share the agile and iterative process of creating Concordia, and the engagement strategies developed to support the public as virtual volunteers with [Library of Congress Digital Collections](https://www.loc.gov/collections/).

This talk is hosted by the [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/) and Digital.gov
