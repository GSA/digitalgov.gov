Coordination and collaboration across disparate, often complex organizational boundaries is inherent in our distributed system of government. One way this shows up frequently is in the process of collecting, aggregating, and sharing data between federal, state, tribal, and local government entities. These data may be used to support policy or budget decisions, to increase operational efficiencies, or be published in aggregate form for other data users. This is what we call a federated data effort. Though they are happening all the time, all across government, there has been very little systemic support or shared processes and infrastructure for these efforts to date; instead, each new effort is still improvising solutions in terms of processes, tooling, and compliance infrastructure, with little sharing of lessons from one effort to the next.

That’s where the [U.S. Data Federation](https://github.com/18F/data-federation-project) comes in. An initiative of the [Technology Transformation Services](https://www.gsa.gov/tts) (TTS) [10x program](https://10x.gsa.gov/) at the [U.S. General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov/) (GSA), the U.S. Data Federation seeks to address the need for knowledge sharing by documenting repeatable processes and developing and curating reusable tools for federated data efforts.

**In this presentation**: Find out how the U.S. Data Federation’s work can help you. The team will give an introduction to the problems the U.S. Data Federation seeks to address, describe its approach, and share its vision for the future of the initiative. The presentation will also include a demo of the first of U.S. Data Federation’s reusable tools, an API-based data validation service.
