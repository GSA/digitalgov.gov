This webinar will walk you through our indexing process, and a new indexing help package that we’ve released. This documentation addresses the most common questions we have received over the past year. This webinar is also an excellent opportunity to ask questions.

## We will cover

- How a page on a sitemap becomes a search result
- What Search.gov indexes from your website
- How we rank search results

This talk is hosted by Search.gov and Digital.gov.
