**On Thursday, September 5th, 2019**, the federal Plain Language community brought together some of the brightest individuals involved in government communications for a one-day series of talks and conversations on how to advance plain language in government communications.

{{< img-right src="plain-language" >}}

We believe the public deserves plain language communication from its government, and [it's the law](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/law/). The benefits of plain language are both tangible and intangible:

- Plain language gets your message across in the shortest time possible.
- More people are able to understand your message.
- There is less chance that your document will be misunderstood, so you spend less time explaining it to people. And if your document gives instructions, your readers are more likely to understand them and follow them correctly.
