Did you know that if you print out all of the federal requirements for digital websites, it is over 2 inches thick (double-sided)?! How do you keep up with everything that is out there? How do you ensure that your organization is complying and provide accurate advice to stakeholders? 

This session will take a look at the multi-tiered challenge of understanding and governing federal digital policy in a complex and ever-changing digital world. It includes a case study of how the [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/) (NIAID/NIH) is attempting to categorize and manage policy compliance. 

Key takeaways will include:

- Recognizing the complexities and challenges of federal digital policy 
- Roadmap to breaking down policy into a consumable and shareable format 
- Future-proof planning 

In her role as Chief of the New Media and Web Policy Branch at the NIAID&mdash;one of the 27 Institutes and Centers of NIH&mdash;**Tori Garten’s** professional goal is to help government function faster, and be more flexible and more fluid, from the inside out. Tori enjoys solving digital communications challenges, and helping others to understand and operate in this ever evolving ecosystem. Tori’s technical and communication skills were developed in the fire of the dot com era, and she has been applying those skills in the challenging government arena for over 16 years. Tori enjoys seeing connections between seemingly unconnected, and applying that perspective to creative ideas and innovative solutions.
