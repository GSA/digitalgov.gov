In this month’s community meeting, we will hear from a [Census] (https://www.census.gov) team that is brand new to DevOps&mdash;failing fast and often, but learning lessons as they undergo a cultural transformation. 

Expect to hear a brief overview of a previous Census Agile IT project called BARCA, as well as a current IT project called JAGUAR. In JAGUAR, the hope is for relevant stakeholders to gradually have and use a more DevOps-centric culture.  
 
Joining us will be Graham Bagget. Graham has worked at the Census Bureau for the past 15 years, first as a GIS software developer, and currently as an IT Manager. He began his career helping Census transition from a legacy GIS topological database into the Master Address File/Toplogically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) database. He participated in the design, development, and maintenance of several MAF/TIGER-based applications, including the Geographic Acquis-based Topological Real-time Editing System (GATRES) and the Block Assessment, Research, and Classification Application (BARCA), which was demonstrated at this year's [ESRI User Conference](https://www.esri.com/videos/watch?&channelid=UC_yE3TatdZKAXvt_TzGJ6mw&playlistid=PLaPDDLTCmy4bC2dGacC3ZH8YnCl4x7kuB).
