Join Paul Lester, Digital Content Specialist for the [Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/) (DOE), to discuss how DOE leveraged the popular TV show, _Stranger Things_ as a conversation starter about the agency’s mission and work using digital media (social media, blog, podcast, etc.). Paul will also discuss how he got management buy-in to use a pop culture phenomenon to promote the agency’s work.

**A list of the blog posts we'll be talking about:**

-  …that resulted in press like this Wired interview: [https://www.wired.com/2016/08/energy-department-responds-stranger-things/](https://www.wired.com/2016/08/energy-department-responds-stranger-things/)
-  We kept it going with our #StrangerThings-themed Halloween! [https://twitter.com/ENERGY/status/793185809549631488](https://twitter.com/ENERGY/status/793185809549631488)
- The next year, we delved deeper into the Upside Down and the work DOE is doing in particle physics with a podcast segment… [https://www.energy.gov/podcasts/direct-current-energygov-podcast/s2-e7-energy-secrets](https://www.energy.gov/podcasts/direct-current-energygov-podcast/s2-e7-energy-secrets)

**Paul Lester** is a digital content specialist in the Department of Energy’s Office of Public Affairs. Paul was born in Ohio but spent most of his life in Florida, where he worked as a news researcher-slash-archivist and online editor for the [Orlando Sentinel](http://www.orlandosentinel.com/).

He moved to Washington in 2008 for a web editor role with [The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/us) before working as a contractor for the [Wind](https://www.energy.gov/node/779761) and [Water](https://www.energy.gov/node/779756) Technologies Office, the [Small Business Administration](https://www.sba.gov/), and DOE’s [Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy](https://www.energy.gov/eere/office-energy-efficiency-renewable-energy). Paul joined the Energy.gov team in March 2015, contributing to [Energy Blog](https://www.energy.gov/blog-archive) and assisting with managing the Energy Department’s [social media channels](https://www.energy.gov/about-us/web-policies/social-media). When he’s not in the office, Paul can be seen slowly running around D.C. training for his next half marathon.
