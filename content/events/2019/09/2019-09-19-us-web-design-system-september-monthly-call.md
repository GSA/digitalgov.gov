Please join Dan Williams, U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) product lead, for an overview of the development process for a USWDS component. He will co-present with Jeremy Zilar of Digital.gov to demonstrate how we start with a problem and work to a solution that could be shared across other websites, as well as answer your questions about the design system. 

This event is part of a monthly series that generally takes place on the third Thursday of each month. The video will be available on Digital.gov shortly after the event.

USWDS is a library of code, tools, and guidance to help government teams design and build fast, accessible, mobile-friendly government websites backed by user research and modern best practices.
