{{< accordion kicker="Slide by Slide" title="USWDS Monthly Call - Presentation Script for February 2024" icon="content_copy" >}}**Slide 1:** Welcome everyone, to the U.S. Web Design System monthly call for February, 2024 — This month we're celebrating Black History Month with shades of green, gold, orange, and brown. As well as Valentine's Day yesterday with shades of pink.

**Slide 2:** My name is Dan Williams, he/him, and I'm the USWDS project lead — and here on-screen is my avatar: dark hair, blue sweater, collared shirt. Today my physical self is wearing a plaid flannel shirt and a fleece, because it's still winter. On my fleece is a green button with some sprouts on it that my son made for me. 

As Jeannie mentioned, we are recording this call, and I'm happy to say we've started to be able to share the recordings of these monthly calls publicly. You can find pretty much everything from the last year's worth of monthly calls — back to January 2023 — on our website, at [designsystem.digital.gov/about/monthly-calls](https://designsystem.digital.gov/about/monthly-calls). We typically post videos within a week of the monthly call, and we also link out to the slides and the script, hosted at digital.gov. We've posted a link to our monthly call page in the chat.

We'll be posting other links and references into the chat as we go along, and I encourage you to ask questions in the chat at any time. If any member of our team can answer your question in the chat, we'll do so, otherwise there'll be some time for questions and answers at the end of the hour. Also, be sure to introduce yourself in the chat as well — it's nice to know who's here. It's good to have you here today. 

For those of you who find the chat distracting, you’re welcome to close or hide the chat window during the main presentation. You can reopen it later during the Q&A session at the end of this call.

So thanks! And, with that, let's get started!

**Slide 3:** So what's our agenda for today?

We’ve got a couple nice new site and feature launches, a couple product updates, and then we’ll spend the rest of the time talking about a USWDS component lifecycle model and our new approach to new-component proposals.

**Slide 4:** Let's get into it with site launches.

**Slide 5:** First, [simpler.grants.gov](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://simpler.grants.gov&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1711052748736300&usg=AOvVaw2YSQ8xGM91WUdioPsTCZMY), an exciting new initiative from the grants.gov team at the department of Health and Human Services. Well, grants.gov provides a centralized location for grant seekers to find and apply for federal funding opportunities. Simpler.grants.gov is a new site from the grants.gov team that's using a transparent, iterative, and agile process to document their progress modernizing and improving the grants.gov service. It's an exciting project where they'll be building software out in the open, and I for one, am pretty interested in their approach and their progress! The simpler.grants.gov homepage features a simple, text-focused layout, with a large blue hero field and the words "We're building a simpler Grants.gov!"

**Slide 6:** Next, [Search.gov](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://search.gov&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1711052748730824&usg=AOvVaw3N-xMZKFbY9VHxVGWKAjS-) is starting to roll out hosted search results pages powered by USWDS code. You know search.gov, right? It's the search engine by and for the federal government, a free service powering search results on over 2,000 websites. Well earlier this year they released a beta of a USWDS-based redesign of their hosted results page. Now Digital.gov is the first site to be able to use it, hosting a USWDS-powered search result layout! Search.gov and DigitalGov — a real chocolate and peanut butter combination in my book. On this slide we see the [Digital.gov search results](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://find.digitalgov.gov/search?utf8%3D%25E2%259C%2593%26affiliate%3Ddigitalgov%26query%3Dusability%26commit%3D&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1711052748731793&usg=AOvVaw1J9MZWOISXo_njMu-hJ7Ti) page for the keyword "usability". We see a clean display of search results, as well as a way to select between all search results and just videos.  

**Slide 7:** Congratulations and great work! Be sure to let our team know when a new site launches, either with an email or a note on the USWDS public Slack channel!
