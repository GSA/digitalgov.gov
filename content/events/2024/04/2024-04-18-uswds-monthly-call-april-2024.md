Web Components have been mentioned in a lot of recent discussions about the future of the U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) . What is this technology, exactly, and what can it mean for the design system?

In this session, the USWDS team will:

* Explain Web Components technology in plain language
* Discuss the value of bringing modern web technologies to the design system
* Explore how using a new technology can affect any user of the design system, not just developers

**This event is best suited for:** All design system users (all levels). This will be a technical discussion, but anyone can attend as it requires no specialized knowledge.

Speakers
* **Dan Williams** **-** Product Lead, USWDS
* **James Mejia** **-** Developer, USWDS contractor
