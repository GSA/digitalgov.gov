Join General Services Administration Administrator Robin Carnahan, Head of White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Dr. Alondra Nelson, and federal citizen science and prize competition and challenge practitioners to celebrate public engagement, the role of community-led partnerships, and equitable forms of participation in innovation and scientific discovery.

Every other year, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy delivers a biennial report to Congress: Implementation of Federal Prizes and Citizen Science Authority. During the FY19-20 reporting period, there were **172 prize competitions and challenges** and **97 crowdsourcing and citizen science activities** — the most activities during any reporting period. From climate change, to COVID-19, to creating new technologies and innovative products, the report demonstrates the breadth of issues addressed through open innovation activities.

At this event we will:

1. Celebrate the role open innovation plays in meeting the federal government's goals for equitable participation to advance innovation, science, and technology.
2. Recognize the achievement of open innovation practitioners across the federal government.
3. Highlight partnerships and equitable forms of participation exemplified through prize competitions and citizen science projects.
4. Explore the future of the federal government’s role in engaging with communities to create and lead innovation and scientific discovery activities.
