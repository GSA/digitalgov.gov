_Spotlight Chats are a series of moderated discussions with innovation leaders across government highlighting success stories and lessons learned._

## Crowd-forecasting Pandemics

In this event, members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Epidemic Prediction Initiative (EPI) will share their experience in developing an open forecasting community. The EPI aims to improve the science and usability of epidemic forecasts by facilitating open forecasting projects with specific public health objectives. They will also share best practices and considerations when organizing similar crowdsourcing initiatives.

The panelists include Matthew Biggerstaff and Michael Johannson of the CDC, Lauren Gardner of Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering, and Evan Roy of Reich Lab, University of Massachusetts Amherst. 

Following the discussion, the panelists will respond to your questions. 

At the end of this session, you will have an understanding of how one organization used crowdsourcing and open data to predict epidemics.
