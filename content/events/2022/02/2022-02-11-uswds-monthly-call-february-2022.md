What would it look like to implement and customize our design system via a component API? 

Join us for a discussion of what might be next for USWDS after the release of USWDS 3.0 this spring.

The USWDS team will discuss how an API might help us work all together more effectively, and how an API might make it easier to maintain and update a USWDS project. 

*This event is part of a monthly series that takes place on the third Thursday of each month. Don’t forget to set a placeholder on your personal calendar for our future events this year.*
