USAGov recognizes that all of us as agencies have a common mission: to serve the public. We work with different agency partners to educate and inform them on various government programs and services. Through these partnerships, we not only engage and guide different audiences, but work to steadily demystify what it means to “market in the Government.”

We’ll focus on discussing these partnerships, how we can best work together, and answer questions that come up in this topic—which is sometimes complex.

In this online event, you’ll learn:

- What marketing and outreach means for us
- Tactics that USAGov uses to promote information and build campaigns
- Specific details of campaigns we have worked on with a variety of agencies
- How to navigate our new [Partnership Toolkit](https://connect.usa.gov/digital-toolkit-ready-to-work) to best understand what we do and how we can work together
