Join the [the Plain Language Community of Practice](https://www.digitalgov.gov/communities/plain-language/) for an hour-long conversation about what makes a good plain language infographic -- one that anyone can understand.

**Weâ€™ll cover:**

- What do you need to consider?
- What questions do you have to answer as you plan to do one?
- How do you deal with data?
- How do you communicate with people who want you to create an infographic?

[Send us a sample](mailto:digitalgovu@gsa.gov "Email a sample infographic to DGU") before the meeting, or add the URL of your infographic when you register.

_The Plain Language Action and Information Network (PLAIN) is a group of federal employees from different agencies and specialties who support the use of clear communication in government writing.
