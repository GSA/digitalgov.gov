Do you want to get more engaged with the video industry within the federal government and learn from the best? Join the Video Production Pros Community for our first meeting to share inspiration, discuss the future of the community and how you can get involved.

During the meeting, three agencies will share case studies about video projects they produced.

Weâ€™d like to get your feedback about the needs of the community around trends, best practices, techniques/tools, strategies, training and social experiences. This will help us plan for potential workshops, events, and networking opportunities in 2018.

There will also be an opportunity for networking after the meeting.
