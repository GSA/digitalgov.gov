Over the past year, [FedRAMP](https://www.fedramp.gov/) gathered feedback from CSPs and JAB review teams on how we could streamline, clarify, and improve the Continuous Monitoring (ConMon) Process. As a result, weâ€™ve made updates to existing documents and created new documents to:

- Improve the overall process and clarify certain elements or expectations
- Make it easier to reference aspects of the process that previously were not documented
- Create structure in parts of the process that may have been interpreted differently by CSPs and JAB Reviewers.

This online event will walk through the [documents that were released](https://www.fedramp.gov/new-conmon-documents-available/) on January 31st and provide the opportunity for participants to ask questions.
