_The [Digital Analytics Program](https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/) (DAP) Learning Series is designed to increase your skills and understanding of DAP's implementation of Google Analytics in the government._

In both our basic and advanced 3-hour classes, we discussed events in Google Analytics. In this online class, we’ll focus entirely on events.

You’ll learn:

- What is an event
- What represents an event on your site
- What events DAP tracks by default
- What event category, action, and label mean
- How to pull events in reporting using both standard and customized reporting
