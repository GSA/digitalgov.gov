We :heart: our volunteers.

This month, we'll be talking about volunteering for help with plainlanguage in the government.
If you're currently volunteering for PLAIN, or interested in volunteering to help with training, posting social media, or anything else, please join us.  _To volunteer, you have to be a federal employee._

Here are some of the topics we'll be discussing:

- social media support
- community management (posting articles to the list serv, prompting conversations)
- helping update website using Github
- monthly meeting coordinator (topics, space, speakers)
- And more!

This meeting will be in-person, but we'll have a conference bridge line setup for remote people to join in the discussion.

_The Plain Language Action and Information Network (PLAIN) is a group of federal employees from different agencies and specialties who support the use of clear communication in government writing. Visit [plainlanguage.gov](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/) or [join the community](https://www.digitalgov.gov/communities/plain-language/)._
