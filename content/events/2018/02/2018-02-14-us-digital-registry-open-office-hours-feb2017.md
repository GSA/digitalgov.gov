On the second Wednesday of every month, from 10:00 - 10:30 am, ET, the U.S Digital Registry team hosts monthly, open-office time to answer questions, discuss ideas, and take feedback about the U.S. Digital Registry.

**About the U.S. Digital Registry**

The [U.S. Digital Registry](https://usdigitalregistry.digitalgov.gov/) serves as a resource for agencies, citizens, and developers to confirm the official status of social media and public-facing collaboration accounts, mobile apps, and mobile websites. The accounts in the registry are independently updated by federal managers across the government who maintain individual agency accounts.
