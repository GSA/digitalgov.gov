- Tips and tricks of moving a story through a bureaucracy


## About the project

Côte d'Ivoire's October 2015 presidential election was the first since the disastrous 2010 election, which left 3,000 dead and hundreds of thousands displaced.

Evan travelled with a photographer to Côte d'Ivoire to meet with Ako Essan Emile, who was the managing director of Radio Arc-en-ciel based in a volatile Abidjan neighborhood greatly affected by the 2010 violence. In the lead up to the 2015 presidential elections, Radio Arc-en-ciel received a USAID grant to promote peaceful messages. This is Ako’s story.

This multimedia story was part of USAID’s story hub built in 2013. At the time of shooting, Evan was in the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance.

## About the presenters

**Evan Matthew Papp** supports the strategic communications, press outreach, digital engagement and public affairs of Power Africa, a U.S. Government-led initiative to double access to electricity in sub-Saharan Africa. The initiative consists of more than 150 public and private sector partners, which have collectively committed more than $54 billion towards achieving Power Africa's goals of 30,000 megawatts and 60 million new connections. It is among the world's largest public-private partnerships in development history.

Evan works on strategic storytelling that resonates with public audiences and policymakers in Washington. Video is his favorite storytelling medium and he is competent in photography, mapping, social media, website design and writing.

Before joining USAID, he spent five years with the Peace Corps working in Zambia, Jamaica and Washington, D.C. He has also started up a few businesses on the side including a farm to table event space in Berkeley Springs, West Virginia and is in the process of launching an artist space called Empathy Media Lab.

Evan learned filmmaking outside of work through night classes, seminars and certificate programs that include DCTV community access training, MediaStorm, and Good Fight Media.

Over the past two years, Bryce has served as the multimedia lead for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which recruited him to establish and grow the agency’s entire multimedia program, including photography and video production. During this short time, Bryce and his team received recognition and praise from top government professionals for their creative and innovative approach to convey complex financial concepts in a simple and engaging way through video. In addition to his work at the CFPB, Bryce mentors students and guest lectures about storytelling for the M.S.Ed. in Education Entrepreneurship capstone course at the University of Pennsylvania.
