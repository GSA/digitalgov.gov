_This meeting is in-person and online for both government employees and stakeholder communities from the public. Capacity is limited for in-person attendance._

On a quarterly basis, the U.S. Federal Emerging Technology monthly meeting for government employees opens the door to public participation so that stakeholders, partners and collaborators can join us in discussing updates in inter-agency Artificial Intelligence, Robotic Process Automation, Virtual/Augmented Reality, Blockchain, and Social Technology programs that are designed to share knowledge and forge consensus to build shared resources and programs.
