Join us on Friday, April 27, at 10 am Pacific / 1 pm Eastern, for our monthly conversation with fellow designers and developers across the government. This month, the U.S. Web Design System team will talk with a team from the [U.S. Digital Service](https://www.usds.gov/) about a library of forms that they've been creating as part of their work with the Department of Veterans Affairs. 

This event will be held over [Zoom](https://www.zoom.us/)
_(see the Zoom [computer and device requirements](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362023-System-Requirements-for-PC-Mac-and-Linux), and [FAQs](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/sections/200277708-Frequently-Asked-Questions))_.
