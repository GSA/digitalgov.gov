Custom campaign URLs can help you collect information to determine which marketing campaigns are more effective. Efficient implementation of custom campaign URLs depends on your tagging strategy and it is important to set up a scalable methodology.

You’ll learn:

- What are custom campaign URLs
- When to use custom campaign URLs
- How to create a tagging strategy
- How to create an Excel or Google Sheet tool with formulas to ensure correct application of custom URL parameters
- How to document your custom URLs to use for reporting later on
