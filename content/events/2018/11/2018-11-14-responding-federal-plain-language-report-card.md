[The Center for Plain Language](https://centerforplainlanguage.org/), a non-profit organization, helps government agencies and businesses write clear and understandable communications.

One of its projects is the [Federal Report Card](https://centerforplainlanguage.org/reports/federal-report-card/2018-report-card/). The Center announced the 2018 results last week.

The Plain Language Action and Information Network (PLAIN)'s October meeting addressed how to start/re-start agency programs. Discussing the report card results with the ideas generated during our October meeting, we hope to get ideas of how to address some of the issues brought up in the report card.
