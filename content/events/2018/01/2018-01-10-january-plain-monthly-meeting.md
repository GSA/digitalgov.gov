Join us for our first Plain Language Action and Information Network (PLAIN) Monthly meeting of 2018 where we will discuss a variety of the toolkits that were discussed at last years Plain International meeting and how valuable they were.

Our goal is to decide on what we should include in our own toolkit.

Start thinking about the resources you would find most useful!


## About the Monthly PLAIN Meetings

Hosted by DigitalGov, meetings are in-person, online, or a mix of both. They are recorded and posted to [DigitalGov's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/digitalgov).

In addition to addressing timely topics, like science communications and health literacy, typical discussions include: plain language training; hands-on editing exercises; how to write for web and social media; and content strategy.
