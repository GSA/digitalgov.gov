Join [the Plain Language Community of Practice](https://www.digitalgov.gov/communities/plain-language/) for an hour-long conversation about how best to revise forms and convince your agency that the long-term benefits outweigh the cost.

Karissa Minnich, from [The Lab @ DC](http://thelab.dc.gov/), will be discussing how the DC government worked to improve their forms at a recent Forms-a-palooza event. Karissa will discuss how The Lab @ DC produced this event and how they choose which forms to revise and improve. She will also outline the benefits they expect to see or have already seen from Forms-a-palooza.

The Lab @ DC uses scientific insights and methods to test and improve policies, and provide timely, relevant, and high-quality analysis to Mayor Bowser's administration.
