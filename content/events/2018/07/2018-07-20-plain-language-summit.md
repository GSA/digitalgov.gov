On Friday, July 20th, the federal [Plain Language community](https://digital.gov/communities/plain-language/) will bring together some of the brightest individuals involved in government communications for a one-day series of talks and conversations on how to advance plain language on government communications.

{{< img-right src="plain-language" caption="" alt="Plain Language / plainlanguage.gov" >}}

Do you work in government communications? Gather your team and join us in-person or online to learn about the importance of plain language and methods for implementing it, and learn from fellow communicators from across the federal government.

We believe the public deserves plain language communication from its government, and [it's the law](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/law/). The benefits of plain language are both tangible and intangible:

- Plain language gets your message across in the shortest time possible.
- More people are able to understand your message.
- There is less chance that your document will be misunderstood, so you spend less time explaining it to people. And if your document gives instructions, your readers are more likely to understand them and follow them correctly.
