Under current law, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) is required to collect key details on federally sponsored challenges and prize competitions that launched, ran or closed during any part of fiscal years 2017 and 2018. OSTP will compile the data into a biennial report that provides insights to Congress and guidance to other agencies.

This year, we’re making it easier! Register for this information sessional to find out:

- How the reporting template has been simplified and how to master a solid report-out

- When your templates are due and and the final report is estimated to publish
