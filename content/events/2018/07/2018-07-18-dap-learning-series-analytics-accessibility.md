_The [Digital Analytics Program](https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/) (DAP) Learning Series is designed to increase your skills and understanding of DAP's implementation of Google Analytics in the government._

In DAP’s newest release (v4.0), we’ve added a custom dimension to let you know whether or not event clicks were completed via click/press vs keystroke. In this training, we’ll show you how to segment to check if behaviors change when people are using keystrokes to click, which might give insight into how users with disabilities interact with your site. We’ll also talk about other features within Google Analytics that may be of value to federal employees concerned with accessibility. Gather your 508 team and join us!

You’ll learn:

- our new “Interaction Type” dimension and how to use it
- how to segment for users using keystrokes
- other accessibility considerations with Google Analytics
