In October 2017, the [New York City Mayor’s Office for Economic Opportunity](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/opportunity/index.page) launched the [Service Design Studio](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/opportunity/portfolio/service-design-studio.page), the first-ever municipal design studio in the country.

The Studio was founded to spread valuable methodologies that are often underutilized inside government. The team functions as internal design consultants to other city agencies and offices to improve the design and delivery of public services.

In a variety of ways, the Studio trains public servants on easy, low-risk methods to involve residents and front-line staff in the design and development of government services. Join this webinar to:

- Learn about the Studio’s core offerings and processes
- Receive an introduction on the [Civic Service Design Tools + Tactics](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/servicedesign/index.html), a set of practical ways to gather insights from the people who depend on your services in their own environments
- How to partner and collaborate with the Studio
