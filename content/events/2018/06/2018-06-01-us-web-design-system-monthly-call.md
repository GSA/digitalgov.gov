Join us on Friday, June 1, at 10 am Pacific / 1 pm Eastern, for our monthly conversation with fellow designers and developers across the government.

This month, [the U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) team will talk with Jacqueline Gu about how her team has been using the USWDS on the redesign of the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) site. She’ll also share the  design system which they’ve expanded upon.

This event will be held over [Zoom](https://www.zoom.us/)
_(see the Zoom [computer and device requirements](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362023-System-Requirements-for-PC-Mac-and-Linux), and [FAQs](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/sections/200277708-Frequently-Asked-Questions))_.
