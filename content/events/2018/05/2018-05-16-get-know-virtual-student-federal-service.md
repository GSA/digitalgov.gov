VSFS is the largest digital internship in the world that connects U.S. college students to the work of the federal government.

Join Bridget Roddy and Nora Dempsey from the U.S. Department of State to learn how U.S. college students working remotely can be virtual interns for you and your teams through the Virtual Student Federal Service (VSFS). VSFS is a free, shared service and projects can be submitted from May 1 to June 10 on [vsfs.state.gov](https://vsfs.state.gov/). 
 
Need inspiration? Check out the [2017-18 cycle’s 540+ projects](http://vsfs.state.gov/projects). VSFS eInterns work ten hours a week from September through May and project mentors interview and select from the applicant pool.
 
### What You’ll Learn
 
In this online event, attendees will:

- Learn how to write and submit a successful project
- Share “how-tos” and “how-nots” of communicating remotely
- Understand the benefits of working with eInterns
- Find inspiration to post a project
  
### More about Virtual Student Federal Service
 
Last year, 4,500+ students applied for a virtual internship position and 1,300 were selected. eInterns are U.S. citizens but do not have security clearances, background checks, or access to internal IT networks so all work is unclassified. Students can help with emerging technology, data visualization, app development, research, reporting, design, AI, usability testing, social media, and more.
 
### Submitting a Project
 
If you are ready to submit a project and have an account, you can use your login again this year. If you don’t have an account, [register with your .gov or .mil email](https://vsfs.state.gov/login), activate your account and submit a project (or two or three). We created a [mentor handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jXrcVTE6HRrK8LGhW49A7thSv-K2CuIdqLS1GaKvL9M/edit?usp=sharing) you can check out about writing a successful project request, how to submit your request, and guidance for supervising eInterns.  
 
### About the Presenters

Passionate about making government better, they run the VSFS program and other creative, visual, and design initiatives including user feedback opportunities (UFO), webinars, and human-centered design.
