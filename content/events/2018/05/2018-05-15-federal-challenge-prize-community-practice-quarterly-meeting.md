In our May 2018 meeting, we learned about a White House roundtable on challenges and prizes, inter-agency partnership opportunities and congressional reporting requirements. We also took a deep dive into hackathons, heard how to power tech-related competitions with the Technology Modernization Fund, and gained tips promoting youth engagement in open innovation activity.

## About the Challenges and Prizes Community of Practice

Our members support and encourage the use of incentivized competitions and challenges to attract and engage the public to meet critical government needs. The community gathers four times a year to share ideas, review best practices, and discuss policies and procedures. Membership and participation is open to federal, state, and local government.
