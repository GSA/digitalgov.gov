In our May 2018 meeting, we learned about a White House roundtable on challenges and prizes, inter-agency partnership opportunities and congressional reporting requirements. We also took a deep dive into hackathons, heard how to power tech-related competitions with the Technology Modernization Fund, and gained tips promoting youth engagement in open innovation activity.
