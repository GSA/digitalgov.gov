The [U.S. General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov/)'s [Emerging Citizen Technology Office](https://emerging.digital.gov/) is kicking off the new fiscal year with a half-day symposium with leading agencies, industry, and civic collaborators. Participants will learn practical innovations available today in Artificial Intelligence, Robotic Process Automation, and other emerging technologies to improve public services for the American people.

Emerging technologies don’t just hold the potential to impact how government delivers services, it is already changing how we manage data-driven decision-making, customer service, and more. To realize emerging technology’s full potential, we must better understand current applications and real-world implications beyond the hype.

During the symposium, you’ll receive hands-on, eyes-on, and voice-on experience with technological services that may seem like public services of tomorrow, but have already been successfully prototyped, piloted, or deployed. No visionary panels or aspirational speeches here—we’re delivering functional instruction, practical application, and lessons learned from the experts who have “been there, done that,” and can help you to do the same.

## Sessions will include:

- Emerging Technologies for Improving Government Services, including Artificial Intelligence, Robotic Process Automation, Blockchain and Virtual/Augmented Reality
- The Business of Emerging Technology for Government Services, including Acquisitions, Venture Capital, the Technology Modernization Fund and more
- Partnerships and Collaboration, including  Academic and Civil Society Outreach, Startup Accelerators and Public/Private Partnerships
- Hands-on Demos and virtual experiences

We are still accepting programming proposals, so, if you have an emerging technology solution in one of the identified tracks that has been used by a federal agency that you would like to showcase, please email us at [emergingtech@gsa.gov](mailto:emergingtech@gsa.gov).

_Presenters and final agenda to be announced._

## What You Will Learn

- Developing and managing emerging tech solutions in federal government
- Understanding what capabilities are available today and what you need to know to make practical decisions in evaluating them
- Working better between government, industry, and civic groups to understand opportunities and obstacles
