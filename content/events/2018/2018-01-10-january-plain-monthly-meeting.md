Join us for our first Plain Language Action and Information Network (PLAIN) Monthly meeting of 2018. 

At the Plain International meeting last year, many presenters discussed toolkits and how valuable they found them.

In our January meeting please help us decide what to include in our toolkit. Let us know what resources you'd find useful.

Start your thinking now!


## About the Monthly PLAIN Meetings

Hosted by DigitalGov, meetings are in-person, online, or a mix of both. They are recorded and posted to [DigitalGov's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/digitalgov).
 
In addition to addressing timely topics, like science communications and health literacy, typical discussions include: plain language training; hands-on editing exercises; how to write for web and social media; and content strategy.
