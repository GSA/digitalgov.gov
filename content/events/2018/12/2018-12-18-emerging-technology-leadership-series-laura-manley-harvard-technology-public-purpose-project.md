According to the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs’ newly launched Technology and Public Purpose Project (TAPP):

> "The arc of innovative progress has reached an inflection point. Technological change has brought immeasurable benefits to billions through improved health, productivity, and convenience. Yet as recent events have shown, unless we actively manage their risks to society, new technologies may also bring unforeseen destructive consequences. Making technological change positive for all is the critical challenge of our time." 

In this next installment of the Emerging Technology Leadership Series we will discuss with Laura Manley, director of Harvard TAPP, what agencies should know about better understanding and managing potential risks from promising emerging technologies. We will also field your questions during this collaborative discussion. 

_The Emerging Technology Leadership Series, hosted by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) [Emerging Citizen Technology Office](https://emerging.digital.gov/) (ECTO), is a monthly webinar to enhance the modern federal workforce with insight into emerging technology issues and management from leading minds outside government._ 

## Who should attend 

Federal employees or anyone who wants to learn more about how government can understand risk management and the impact of emerging technologies on public services, and what resources and partnerships exist to help guide us. 

## Presenters

**Justin Herman** is the lead of GSA’s Emerging Citizen Technology Office, which collaborates with more than 320 U.S. federal, state and local agencies, as well as startups, small businesses, and civic organizations to develop government-wide public service modernization initiatives for emerging technologies. 

**Laura Manley** is the inaugural Director of the Technology and Public Purpose Project at Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. Led by former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, the project aims to steer rapid technology-driven change in directions that serve net, long-term public good. Manley is also a Senior Consultant for the World Bank Group and the United Nations Department for Economic and Social Affairs. 

Previously, Manley co-founded the Center for Open Data Enterprise in Washington DC, which is a nonpartisan research organization that works with governments to leverage data for social and economic good.
