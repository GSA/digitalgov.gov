USPS.com is an anomaly among U.S. federal government websites. An eCommerce platform that generates over $1 billion in annual revenue, it collaborates with international postal services while partnering and competing with private-sector partners (FedEx, UPS, Stamps.com, etc.) and eCommerce websites of all sizes. As a result, USPS.com exists in two worlds: that of a highly regulated government website, and that of for-profit private business.

The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) has adopted a customer experience (CX) continuous improvement approach to blend federal digital standards and best practices with the tools and techniques of private industry and eCommerce. Our method merges analytics and customer feedback with iterative heuristic reviews, design, and usability testing. This approach allows us to monitor, improve, and evolve our CX from both the quantitative and qualitative perspectives. 

Attendees will walk away with an understanding of:

* The growth and evolution of the USPS.com analytics and feedback practice
* An approach to combining qualitative customer survey data and quantitative website traffic data
* How USPS has used targeted, reoccurring and ad-hoc reports that promote a data-driven, evidence-based design approach while focusing usability studies
* An introduction to the USPS’ customized usability heuristics (mapped to the Usability.gov Research-Based Web Design Usability Guidelines (WDUG)), team-based heuristic evaluation approach, and menu of usability testing services
* The importance of engaging in continuous, often iterative heuristic evaluations, compliance reviews, and usability testing
* Methods of benchmarking against peers, competitors, and best-in-class eCommerce sites to remain current with the evolving digital landscape and expectations
* How the above analytics and continuous improvement approach has helped USPS promote, protect, and expand its brand while growing revenue (especially in extraordinary times, like during the novel coronavirus pandemic).
