The U.S. General Services Administration’s [10x](https://10x.gsa.gov/) program is unique from other crowdsourcing programs in a few key ways:

1. It is government-wide. 
2. Products funded by 10x must be reusable across government. 
3. Idea authors and project teams are intentionally distanced. 

Key takeaways from the session will include:

* An overview of the 10x process. 
* Advantages and challenges in the government-wide scope. 
* Pros and cons of a framework where the idea originator is not part of the project team.
