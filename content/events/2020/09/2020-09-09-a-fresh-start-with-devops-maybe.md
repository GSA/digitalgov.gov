When you define ‘legacy’ as applications or systems which are less than five years old, adopting a DevOps way of working should offer an organization a fresh start. However, beginning with a blank slate does not mean that integrating the philosophy is without challenges.

No Legacy DevOps is the telling of the tale of the DevOps team at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) and the sharing of the challenges encountered, mistakes made, and the resulting strategy captured from the valuable lessons learned and learning.

## Speaker:

Senior Application Developer/Architect and Lead DevOps Engineer, **Rayvn Manuel**, serves within the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) Digital Media group. She is the principal programmer responsible for the planning, design, and implementation of some of the web-based interactives developed by the museum.

As the DevOps team lead, Rayvn is responsible for defining standards and workflows, and recommending appropriate tools NMAAHC’s development teams adopt or adapt to produce the museum’s digital products. She serves as the primary administrator of the agency’s cloud-based resources.

Along with advising leadership about the state of app development & DevOps best practices and tools, Rayvn is responsible for ensuring that the unit’s digital products are developed and delivered in compliance with established DevOps guidelines, as well as unit-level and Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) security protocols.
