In this talk, Ron Williams and Carlo Costino will share insights into how agencies can use cloud services in a cost-effective manner. 

Leveraging highly-scalable, on-demand cloud services supports the delivery of a modern government customer experience. However, effectively infinite compute capabilities must be balanced with targeted usage monitoring and sensible policies to deliver the best value. 

Key takeaways include: 

 - establishing reporting with expense dashboards, 
 - in-depth performance metrics, and 
 - insights on when to apply paid analytics to control costs.

As an open-source advocate, Ron focuses on deploying disruptive technologies within public sector institutions to improve services provided to the general public.
