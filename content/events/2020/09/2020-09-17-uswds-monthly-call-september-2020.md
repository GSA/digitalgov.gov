This event is part of a monthly series that takes place on the third Thursday of each month. We post the video on Digital.gov shortly after each event.

This month, Dan Williams, USWDS product lead, will introduce and demo three new components:

* **Identifier.** The identifier, a supplement to your  standard site footer,  discloses a site's parent agency and displays agency links required by federal policy.
* **Time picker.** The time picker is one of two new additions to the forms components that allow visitors to select a time from a drop-down menu.
* **Step indicator.** The step indicator is the second addition to the forms components that allow users to follow their progress in a step-by-step process.

USWDS is a library of principles, guidance, and code to help government teams design and build fast, accessible, mobile-friendly government websites backed by user research and modern best practices.
