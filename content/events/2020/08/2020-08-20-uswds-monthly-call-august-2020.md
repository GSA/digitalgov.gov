This month, Dan Williams, USWDS product lead, is joined by Suran De Silva, user experience (UX) product manager at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), in a discussion about UX debt and how it can impact the efficiency and quality of your products and services. Together, they will cover: 

* what UX debt is, 
* why it can be an issue, 
* how to identify it, and 
* tips to reduce UX debt in your work.

This event is part of a monthly series that takes place on the third Thursday of each month. We post the video on Digital.gov shortly after each event.
