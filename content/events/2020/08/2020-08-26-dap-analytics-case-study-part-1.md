Understanding how to pull reporting in Google Analytics is only part of the puzzle.

Google Analytics tells you the "Who", the "How" and the "What" — but it doesn't tell you the "Why".

**In this talk**, we'll connect the dots between your organization's website strategy to help you better navigate how to think about the "Why", and how assessing your analytics strategy cascades throughout your DAP Google Analytics reporting experience.

We'll illustrate how your strategy serves as the linchpin and foundation of your website reporting, and provide some helpful guidance and tips on assessing your strategy.
