In the second part of our Analytics Case Study series, we'll address how to pull reporting and conduct analysis through the lens of your analytics strategy.

You will need to have attended, or viewed the recording of [Analytics Case Study Part 1]({{< ref "2020-08-26-dap-analytics-case-study-part-1.md" >}}), and identified your website mission, goals and KPIs.

We'll walk through step by step, how to pull reporting using an example agency's site and data. The goal of the webinar is to empower you with a real world example about how to tie your metrics to your website mission, goals and KPIs.
