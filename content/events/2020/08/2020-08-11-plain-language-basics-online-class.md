U.S. government agencies are required to communicate in plain language. This three-hour online workshop by the [Plain Language Action and Information Network](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/) (PLAIN) through Digital.gov explains how to write in plain language.

We'll cover the following:

 - Definition of plain language
 - Background
 - The law - Plain Writing Act of 2010 and executive orders
 - Federal Plain Language Guidelines
    - Write for your audience
    - Organize your information
    - Choose your words carefully
    - Be concise
    - Keep it conversational
    - Design for reading
    - Follow web standards
    - Test your assumptions
    
We’ll use plenty of before-and-after examples.
