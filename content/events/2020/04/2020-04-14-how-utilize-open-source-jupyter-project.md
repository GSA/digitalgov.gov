**In this talk**, we will introduce the Jupyter Project and how it is being used by the greater research community to engage in technical discussions surrounding data analytics, artificial intelligence products, machine-learning models, and reproducing results.

We’ll walk through some of the ways to help break down common challenges into smaller, more decomposable problems and be able to showcase solutions utilizing the Jupyter Project. We'll also discuss how to navigate Jupyter notebook, and showcase how easy it is to render mathematical expressions using Jupyter built in support for Latex and show how easy it is to wrangle data.


## Presenter

**Joseph Raetano** is an AI Lead at the Centers of Excellence within GSA focusing on supporting executive-level AI initiatives across the federal government. Joseph is a veteran naval officer and DoE researcher. He has spent more than three years developing new programs in artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and natural language understanding. He has more than six years of experience involving various transportation-based initiatives at both the [Oak Ridge National Lab](https://www.ornl.gov/) and commercial sectors. He has a career supported by a MS Computer Science and Ph.D. (ABD) Computer Science focusing on Mobile Edge machine learning and artificial Intelligence.
