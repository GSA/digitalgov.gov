Many questions exist in terms of how to engage in technical discussions surrounding data analytics, AI products, ML Models, and reproducing results. In this talk, we will walk through some of the ways to help break down these challenges into smaller, more decomposable problems and be able to showcase solutions utilizing the Jupyter Project.
