title: "The Hero's Journey for Re-Skilling Talent (And Other Digital Adventures)"
deck: ""
summary: "For those seeking ways to internally re-skill their workforce for digital transformation, a look at mythology reveals a recurring theme where those answering the call are involved in an iterative  cycle of 'leveling-up', a theme that may help change-agents set conditions for successful retention and growth of organic digital talent."

What does Star Wars, The Matrix, and The Hobbit have to do with re-skilling your workforce? Taking a look at the archetypes and patterns from [the hero's journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero's_journey), we'll share some anecdotes on how this applies to our current digital transformation efforts in the federal workforce. We'll also discuss that when we answer the call to adventure, we often find the answers were not out in the unknown, but within each of us before we started the journey.

## Presenter
