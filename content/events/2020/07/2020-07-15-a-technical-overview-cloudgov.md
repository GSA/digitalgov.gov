cloud.gov is a sophisticated and complex platform. Using visual diagrams, we will walk through the architecture of major system components including AWS GovCloud, AWS Commercial, and Cloud Foundry. In addition, this webinar will review marketplace services and the availability of on-demand provisioning, understanding how traffic gets to an app via CDN and non-CDN apps, and finally how to engage with cloud.gov about feature requests.

## Presenter:

**Steve Greenberg** is an industry veteran with more than 20 years of experience in the architecture, operations, and development of custom applications. He is a proud Cloud Foundry Ambassador, an active member of the Cloud Foundry community, a technical advisor to the Cloud Foundry Foundation, and the recipient of the Cloud Advocate community award. A frequent open source contributor, he is the original author of the Spring Cloud Service Broker. He is currently working on the cloud.gov team as a platform operator (contractor).
