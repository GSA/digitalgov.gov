This month, Dan Williams, USWDS product lead, led a demonstration of several newly released USWDS components, including file input, breadcrumb, tooltip, and the long-awaited date picker. Dan and team also discussed updates to the USWDS gov banner.

This event is part of a monthly series that takes place on the third Thursday of each month. We post the video on Digital.gov shortly after each event.
