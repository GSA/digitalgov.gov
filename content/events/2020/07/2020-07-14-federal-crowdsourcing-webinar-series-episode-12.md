The U.S. Air Force aims high in recruiting the best and brightest to support our nation’s defense apparatus. So, naturally, it recognizes the tremendous talent of its airmen to unlock innovation across the service. 

Enter AFWERX, a community of innovators with a diverse set of skills, passions and roles within the service -- including active duty, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, Air Force Civilian Service, and contractor personnel -- as well as industry and academia.

AFWERX positions itself as a catalyst for bringing traditional and nontraditional partners together to foster a culture of innovation within the Air Force. 

Across its innovation hubs and tech accelerators, via competitive prize challenges and “Spark Tank” research pitches, AFWERX is setting the stage to develop transformative solutions that enhance the effectiveness of the nation’s flying force.

## Presenter:

**Joseph “Joey” Arora** is the co-founder of Air Force Ventures and AFWERX, where he directs ecosystem development for Air Force innovation. Joey strives to unite the country’s defense apparatus and startup space to reshape how the Air Force invests in small businesses and meet national security imperatives. He is an Air Force captain and has served as an airfield operations officer in the United States and Afghanistan. He has facilitated Startup Weekends across the country.

**Steve "Elmo" Lauver** is a co-founder of Air Force Ventures and AFWERX, where he leads the tech accelerator portfolio and is a program manager for Air Force Innovation. He breaks down barriers for the warfighter to leverage commercial technology while reimaging how the Air Force partners, engages, and invests in nontraditional businesses. He is an Air Force Captain who has served as a pilot for Air Force Special Operations Command and has multiple deployments under his belt. He also loves skydiving.
