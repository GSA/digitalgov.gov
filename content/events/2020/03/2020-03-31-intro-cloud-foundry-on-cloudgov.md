Are you a [Cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/) customer—or potential customer—interested in how Cloud.gov can simplify and accelerate your development organizations? In this guided demonstration, we walk you through the basics of using the core Cloud.gov platform called [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/)— an open source cloud application platform. We highlight the simplicity that Cloud Foundry brings to developer workflows through its use of high-level abstractions and APIs, and discuss the impact of using cloud.gov and Cloud Foundry on a developer's responsibilities.

In this session, we will start by deploying an application to Cloud.gov. We will then provision a database instance and connect the app to it. We will then scale the application before programmatically killing an app instance and observing one of the resiliency features of the platform.

While this session will focus on developer interactions, it is ideal for anyone interested in how Cloud.gov technology differs from other platforms and cloud offerings.
