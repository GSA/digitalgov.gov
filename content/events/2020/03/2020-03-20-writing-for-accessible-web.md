Interested in how to write accessible web content? Then watch this special presentation featuring 18f Content Strategist, Ryan Johnson, as he dives into how you can effectively write accessible web content.

Do you create content for a website or digital product? Do you contribute documents, text, or images that end up on a website or digital product? Regardless of your role in government, you’re a content creator.

We all communicate with each other and the public in the course of our duties. And yet, accessibility is often viewed through the lens of software development or visual design. This presentation focuses on what we can all do to design content that is accessible to everyone.
