For this month's call, Dan Williams, USWDS product lead, shares the design system’s 2020 roadmap. He discusses ways users can successfully adopt and adapt USWDS incrementally over time, with a focus on the design system’s color tokens.

This event is part of a monthly series that takes place on the third Thursday of each month. We post the video on Digital.gov shortly after each event.
