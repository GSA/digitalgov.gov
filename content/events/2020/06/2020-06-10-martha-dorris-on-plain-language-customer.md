Citizens deserve a 21st-century experience when interacting, engaging, and transacting with the government. When the public wants to engage with the government—whether a website, call, email, chat, virtual agent, or in person—they want the answer to their question or to solve their problem at the first contact. In times of crisis, the public needs government information and services more than ever before. 
 
In this webinar, you will learn: 

- what customer experience (CX) is versus customer service
- the importance of delivering outstanding services and easily accessible and easy to understand information 
- where the government is moving in CX
- using plain language to create content that is understandable
