In 2016, the Census Bureau created a translation office to standardize the quality, style, and terminology of translations. The language support for the 2020 Census is a significant expansion of previous censuses, and is the most robust language program that the U.S. Census Bureau has ever built. Respondents can respond online or by phone in English and 12 non-English languages, and access video and print guides in 59 non-English languages (supporting over 99% of all U.S. households).

In this presentation, 2020 Census language program experts will provide an overview and demonstration of non-English instruments, questionnaires, and materials, and discuss the processes, technology, and tools used.

## Presenters:

**Jennifer Kim** is an Assistant Division Chief for Content, Translation, Puerto Rico and Island Areas Operations at the U.S. Census Bureau. She has served as the chair of the Decennial Content Council, lead language expert for the Census Bureau’s National Advisory Committee Language Working Group, and a Census Bureau representative on the International Census Forum Content Working Group. She holds a Ph.D. in International Education Policy from the University of Maryland, M.S. in International and Intercultural Education from the University of Southern California, and B.A. in Linguistics and Spanish from the University of Michigan.

**Marisa Hotchkiss** is the Chief of the Content and Language Branch at the U.S. Census Bureau. The Content and Language Branch manages the content and design of 2020 Census questionnaires and associated non-questionnaire materials, and identifies ways to reduce language barriers for limited-English-speaking households. She holds bachelor's degrees in Economics and Spanish, a master's degree in Public Management, a master's certificate in Project Management, and the Project Management Professional (PMP) certification.

**Jason Kopp** is the 2020 Census Advisor to American Samoa at the U.S. Census Bureau. He oversees the 2020 Census of American Samoa to ensure a complete and accurate count.

In that position, he hired and recruited all branch staff, and created a standardized approach to translation workflow and quality assurance for translation requests across the agency.
