Data-informed design — the development and use of hard evidence to support design decisions — can be a powerful way to speak to stakeholders in ways they can hear. However, getting started can be daunting. Designers not only need the activities and tools to gather data and evidence, but a roadmap for how to effectively use what they have gathered (no one wants to create reports that won’t be read).

The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) Office of Strategic Communications (OSC) manages GSA.gov, the GSA intranet (known as InSite), and other digital initiatives. In this webinar, we’ll share how we have been working together to make use of analytics, usability testing, and related research techniques to not just make notable design improvements to certain website areas, but to also improve the prominence of user experience design within GSA as a whole.

In this webinar, you’ll learn about:

 - Insights into activities, tools, and practical ways to promote data-driven design decision making
 - How we have been using analytics, usability testing, and research techniques to create positive change for GSA’s online properties.
 - Impact that’s been created so far, and how it has come about and challenges ahead.

By the end of this webinar, you’ll have a good understanding of the starting blocks to implementing a data-informed approach within your organization.
