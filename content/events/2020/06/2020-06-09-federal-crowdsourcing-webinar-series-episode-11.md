Once simply a smart feature, mobile-friendly sites have evolved into must-have components of every organization’s digital presence, and now mobile accounts, for more than half of all web activity.

More importantly, it’s the law: With the passage of the [21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act](https://digital.gov/resources/21st-century-integrated-digital-experience-act/) (21st Century IDEA) of 2018, public-facing government websites and digital services must be functional and usable on any mobile device.

So how do you know if your application is functioning properly on different mobile devices? You take it to the testers.

The [CrowdSource Mobile Testing Program](https://digital.gov/services/mobile-application-testing-program/) is a network of federal employees who voluntarily test agency website displays across devices, operating systems, and mobile browsers. The results they provide can immediately be applied to make federally hosted information more available and accessible to citizens on the go.

On the other side of the coin, participating in mobile test cycles helps educate federal employees on mobile technologies.

See how this crowdsourcing approach has provided a broad set of helpful data and recommendations, helping agencies at significant cost avoidance to the government.

## Presenter:

**David Fern** is an information technology (IT) specialist in the Social Security Administration’s Office of IT Enterprise Business Support. A long-time advocate for mobile experience, David is a co-leader of the Federal MobileGov Community of Practice and the CrowdSource Mobile Testing Program, working closely with more than 300 volunteers and counterparts across over 30 government agencies. His biweekly Mobile Trends Tickers email is a widely distributed resource on all-things mobile.

_This talk is hosted by [Challenge.gov](http://www.challenge.gov). Managed by GSA, Challenge.gov serves as both the official listing of prize competitions across government, as well as a centralized platform for federal agencies to market their problem-solving events. The program also designs resources and training, which have helped more than 102 federal agencies run over 1,100 prize competitions with public participation since 2010._
