Dan Williams, U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) product lead, and 18F teammates discussed how the design system helps design teams solve problems and encourage team collaboration. Most importantly, they addressed why, even when using a design system like USWDS, teams still need a designer.

This event is part of a monthly series that takes place on the third Thursday of each month. We post the video on Digital.gov shortly after each event.

USWDS is a library of principles, guidance, and code to help government teams design and build fast, accessible, mobile-friendly government websites backed by user research and modern best practices.
