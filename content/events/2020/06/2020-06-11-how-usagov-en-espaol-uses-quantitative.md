Understanding the needs of an audience is key in order to be able to develop the right content. We will show how USAGov en Espa&#241;ol continuously gathers and analyzes quantitative and qualitative data from a variety of channels, including the USAGov Contact Center, to meet the constantly evolving needs of our Spanish-language users.

We will demo how we use the [Digital Analytics Program](https://digital.gov/services/dap/) (DAP) and other tools to collect data. We will also show a few examples of how we conduct our analysis to be able to make recommendations.

## Presenters:

She creates content in Spanish for USAGov en Espa&#241;ol&mdash;for both the site and social media. She also analyzes data from the USAGov Contact Center. With this data, she develops monthly reports outlining trends and makes recommendations to improve the customer experience both on and offline.

**Andres Quiñones** is a bilingual data analyst with many years of experience in optimization strategy, search and data analysis, and data storytelling.
