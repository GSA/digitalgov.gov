For this month's U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) monthly call Dan Williams, product lead, will discuss the design system in greater detail. Time will be set aside for a live Q&A session between attendees and Dan.

This event is part of a monthly series that takes place on the third Thursday of each month. We post the video on Digital.gov shortly after each event.

USWDS is a library of principles, guidance, and code to help government teams design and build fast, accessible, mobile-friendly government websites backed by user research and modern best practices.
