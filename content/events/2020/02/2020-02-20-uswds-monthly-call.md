The February 2020 U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) monthly call is all about the new [website standards](https://designsystem.digital.gov/website-standards/). Join Dan Williams, USWDS product lead, and a cross-agency panel to discuss what it means for digital product teams to have new website standards—what questions we have, and what challenges and opportunities the standards provide.

This event is part of a monthly series that takes place on the third Thursday of each month. We post the video on Digital.gov shortly after each event.
