Join Dan Williams, USWDS Product Lead, and a cross-agency panel to discuss what it means for digital product teams to have a new website standard — what questions we have, and what challenges and opportunities the standard provides

This event is part of a monthly series that takes place on the third Thursday of each month. We post the video on Digital.gov shortly after each event.
