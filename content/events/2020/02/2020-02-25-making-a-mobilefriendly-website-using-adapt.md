The 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act ([21st Century IDEA](https://digital.gov/resources/21st-century-integrated-digital-experience-act/)) requires federal websites to be "fully functional and usable on common mobile devices." Mobile-friendliness, however, can mean a variety of things, depending on the perspective of a user.

David Fern, co-lead of the MobileGov Community and the Federal Crowdsource Mobile Testing Program, knows a lot about making websites and content mobile-friendly. This webinar gives you insights into his approach—the ADAPT Model—which looks to ensure that websites are mobile-friendly:

- **A**ssess Your Site
- **D**etermine Challenges
- **A**lign Solutions
- **P**erform Enhancements
- **T**est Again

He'll walk you through this approach, give you some resources for testing your site or content, and answer any questions that you have about mobile-friendliness.
