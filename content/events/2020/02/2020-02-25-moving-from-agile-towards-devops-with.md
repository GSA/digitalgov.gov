Chris Lauer will share the initial steps taken by the [Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/) to implement agile and DevOps methods. The office has a number of constraints, including a relatively small development and IT team. Chris will share their lessons learned with participants, including their failures and successes. This event should be of interest to government technical staff and leadership curious about how and where to start when implementing agile and DevOps.

## Speaker

**Chris Lauer** started his federal career at the U.S. National Hurricane Center as a meteorologist and programmer, where his most notable impact was the Tropical Cyclone Overview graphic on the front page of [www.hurricanes.gov](http://www.hurricanes.gov/). Chris now works at the U.S. Space Weather Prediction Center as a senior application software developer and product owner where he has led a shift towards agile and DevOps methodologies.
