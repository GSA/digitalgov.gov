Creating and integrating an analytics function into any team or organization is challenging. We'll discuss:
-   How do I justify a web analyst role on my team?
-   How do I make the business case for this role to my leadership?
-   How many analysts do I need?
-   How should an analyst integrate into my team for the best results?
-   What hats would an analyst need to wear?

We'll address these questions and more in this DAP series webinar.
