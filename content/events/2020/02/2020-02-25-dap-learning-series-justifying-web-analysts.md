Creating and integrating an analytics function into any team or organization is challenging. We'll discuss: 

- How do I justify a web analyst role on my team?
- How do I make the business case for this role to my leadership?
- How many analysts do I need?
- How should an analyst integrate into my team for the best results?
- What hats would an analyst need to wear?

We'll address these questions and more in this _DAP Learning Series_ webinar.
