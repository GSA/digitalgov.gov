Often, getting started with Google Analytics seems daunting; a new interface, new terms, and new things to understand.

In this session, we’ll try to get you acquainted with the Google Analytics interface, show you how DAP is unique, review common terminology, and get your feet wet with the basic reports you can use to analyze your web traffic.
