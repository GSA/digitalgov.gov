Federal government agencies produce translations of a variety of materials, from surveys to websites, with the goal of increasing the reach of our programs and federal data resources. This talk uses survey translation as an illustration of the complexities and potential pitfalls involved in providing resources in multiple languages.

We will review the intricacies of multilingual survey design, give an overview of the literature on survey translation, and we will discuss how to include the end users of our products in the development through pretesting. This talk will also include tips for monolingual speakers of English who manage the translation and pre testing process.
