Join us for a live showcase of some of the most innovative projects in government. In this event, several 10x-funded projects will give an overview of their work, an update on the current status, and discuss other ways in which the 10x approach is unique.

In a set of 5-minute presentations, the 10x project teams will outline:

 - The original pitch
 - A brief summary of work conducted in the prior phases
 - Current project status
 - How to get in touch with projects and the 10x team
