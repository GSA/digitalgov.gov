The January 2020 U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) monthly call is all about the USWDS maturity model. Dan Williams, product lead, will discuss how to use the [maturity model](https://designsystem.digital.gov/maturity-model/) to evaluate your own projects, and how teams can use that evaluation to plan for the future. There will also be time for a live Q&A session.

This event is part of a monthly series that takes place on the third Thursday of each month. We post the video on Digital.gov shortly after each event.

USWDS is a library of principles, guidance, and code to help government teams design and build fast, accessible, mobile-friendly government websites backed by user research and modern best practices.
