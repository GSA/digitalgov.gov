{{< note >}}
This presentation (PDF, 3.6 MB, 51 pages), crafted by Dr. Meredith Larson of the U.S. Department of Education, offers detailed information on literacy skills of U.S. adults, including digital literacy, and the implications for communicating with the public. 
{{< /note >}}

When communicating with the public, we must change our assumptions about their ability to understand text. This is especially true when the information keeps changing and is complex, or the stakes are high and people are in crisis.

Over 50% of U.S. adults score below an international benchmark for literacy, with roughly 20% scoring at the very lowest levels. These adults span all demographics and are a part of your audience. Don’t assume they’re not.

You must  communicate clearly with your audience. Keep it simple and convenient, and use plain language. Present the most important information you want to convey first. Get feedback from your readers on whether they understand the information you’re trying to convey.

## Background

The [Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/piaac/) (PIAAC) is an international, [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development](https://www.oecd.org/) (OECD) study used to assess the skills of literacy, numeracy, and digital problem solving in adults between the ages of 16 and 65. After collecting information on how their country’s population is performing, leaders can better target and help their people get access to the resources they need. 

## Basic Skills Assessed

PIAAC is designed to assess adults in different countries over a broad range of abilities, from simple reading to complex problem-solving skills. A country can check how its population stands in relation to the rest of the participating countries. 

PIAAC has four domains: 

### 1. Literacy
"Literacy is understanding, evaluating, using, and engaging with written text to participate in the society, to achieve one's goals, and to develop one's knowledge and potential." Find out more about literacy: https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/piaac/literacy.asp.

### 2. Numeracy
"The ability to access, use, interpret, and communicate mathematical information and ideas, to engage in and manage mathematical demands of a range of situations in adult life." Find out more about numeracy: https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/piaac/numeracy.asp

### 3. Digital problem solving in technology-rich environments
"Using digital technology, communication tools, and networks to acquire and evaluate information, communicate with others, and perform practical tasks." Find out more about problem-solving: https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/piaac/problem-solving.asp

### 4. Reading components
“Focuses on elements of reading that are comparable across the range of languages in the participating countries: reading vocabulary, sentence comprehension, and basic passage comprehension.” Find out more about reading components: https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/piaac/reading-components.asp
