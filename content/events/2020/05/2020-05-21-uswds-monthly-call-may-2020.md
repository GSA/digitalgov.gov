The May 2020 USWDS monthly call focused on the design system’s card and forms components. USWDS team members and Product Lead, Dan Williams, also talked about ways to use data visualization to improve website user experience.

This event is part of a monthly series that takes place on the third Thursday of each month. We post the video on Digital.gov shortly after each event.
