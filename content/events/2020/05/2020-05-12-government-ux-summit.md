Government agencies are striving to provide a better user experience (UX) for everyone, especially with the passage of [21st Century IDEA](https://digital.gov/topics/21st-century-idea/). The 2020 Government UX Summit is a great opportunity to hone your UX skills with the best and brightest UX researchers and designers from across the government.

We are currently seeking submissions for presentations on topics such as:

 - Design and evaluation methods (especially more applied topics, such as training with a particular method)
 - Case studies of UX projects or programs
 - UX tools
 - Starting and building a government UX program
 - Lessons learned in managing a user experience program
 - Government-specific challenges and obstacles
 - UX and Agile
 - Using UX to innovate
 - UX research

Presentations can be in the following formats:

 - 10-minute presentations, where speakers can present short discussions or brief highlights
 - 45-minute presentations, where speakers can discuss case studies or share lessons learned with a project or method
 - 90-minute sessions, where speakers can provide more in-depth training on a UX method

Eligible presenters include U.S. local, state, tribal, and federal government employees (all levels) and contractors with U.S. government email addresses (with their agency’s approval). Speakers from outside DC can present remotely.

Submissions are due by close of business on Friday, March 6. For more information on requirements for submitting, please contact Jean Fox at [Fox.Jean@bls.gov](mailto:Fox.Jean@bls.gov).

## **Presenters**

Presenters will be announced after a peer review process in late March or early April.
