The Social Media Community of Practice (CoP) was launched in June 2012 to research, evaluate, and implement emerging social technologies and strategies to help the American public understand and access services and explain the role of government in their lives. The CoP connects digital managers and specialists in government as part of an effort aimed at improving how digital engagement programs are created, adopted, and evaluated.

## What We Do

The CoP hosts educational and networking events, and provides resources to members with the goal of improving social media and new digital media outreach efforts. Social media managers face many of the same challenges – join the community to connect with others.

## Who We Are

The CoP includes social media communicators of all specialties and experience levels. If you work in government social media, this community is for you.
