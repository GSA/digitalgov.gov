The SocialGov Community of Practice (CoP) was launched in June 2012 to research, evaluate, and implement emerging social technologies and strategies to help the American public understand and access services and explain the role of government in their lives. The CoP connects digital managers and specialists at federal, tribal, state, and local agencies as part of an effort aimed at improving how digital engagement programs are created, adopted, and evaluated.

## What We Do

SocialGov hosts educational and networking events, and provides free resources to government employees with the goal of improving social media and new digital media outreach efforts at every level of government. Social media managers face many of the same challenges â€“ join SocialGov to connect with others _who get it_.

## Who We Are

SocialGov includes government social media communicators of all specialties and experience levels. If you work in government social media, this community is for you.
