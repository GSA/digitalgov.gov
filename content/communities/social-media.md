### Who we are

The Federal SocialGov Community unites over 1,200 digital managers and specialists at more than 160 agencies and offices in a collaborative program aimed at improving the creation, adoption and evaluation of digital engagement programs.

The SocialGov Community launched in June 2012 as a performance-based inter-agency collaboration, working with missions across government, the [White House](http://www.whitehouse.gov/), international partners, public-private partnerships, and citizens to promote the effective and responsible use of social media and digital engagement for measurably improving citizen services, making them more inclusive and accessible, and reducing their costs.

### What We Do

We identify opportunities and challenges to improve government use of social data, and collectively address them for the shared benefit of all agencies. We support the creation of online communities that provide opportunities for citizens to collaborate, participate, and engage with their government.

  * Best practices: We curate [best practices]({{< link "categories/socialmedia" >}} "Social Media") for innovative, effective, and responsible use and governance of social media across the government.
  * Training: We research, organize, and host live and on-demand [social media training for all agencies]({{< link "events" >}} in federal, state, and local government.
  * Shared tools: We actively test and evaluate emerging social tools and strategies for government and negotiate [federal-compatible terms of service]({{< link "federal-compatible-terms-of-service-agreements.md" >}} "Federal-Compatible Terms of Service Agreements") for federal agencies.
  * Working Groups and Resource Development: We organize productive working groups that produce shared resources for all agencies to use, like the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/02/03/announcing-us-public-participation-playbook" target="_blank">U.S. Public Participation Playbook</a> and the <a href="{{< link "readiness-recovery-response-social-media-cyber-vandalism-toolkit.md" >}}" target="_blank">Cyber-Vandalism Toolkit</a>.
