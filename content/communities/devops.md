The DevOps Community of Practice (CoP) provides information technology and development staff and leadership throughout government the opportunity to share lessons learned, successes, benefits, and know how related to DevOps.

Government agencies are investing in cloud capabilities and are seeking to work more iteratively, improving their ability to support the public through their digital services. The DevOps CoP allows agencies to share their innovations and successes, reducing the “cost of learning and innovating” across government.

**DevOps** is the practice of operations and development staff participating together in the entire service lifecycle operating rapidly changing resilient systems at scale.

**We work towards the following:**

- This CoP allows technical staff and leadership from across government to share their experiences and lessons learned implementing DevOps and agile practices, as well as their efforts to migrate data and services to the cloud.
- We aim to help reduce the learning curve associated with individual agencies, bureaus, and offices adopting cloud capabilities and DevOps practices. The DevOps CoP allows agencies to learn from one another, sharing technical know-how. We also promote the adoption of DevOps, knowing that DevOps techniques and technologies can not only save time and reduce costs, but also be a vehicle for innovation.
- As the U.S. government procures cloud capabilities, there is an opportunity to reduce cost, improve performance, and improve the speed to which data and digital services are provided to the public. An opportunity also exists to improve the speed at which software can be delivered to users.
