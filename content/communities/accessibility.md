## Who We Are

The IT Accessibility Community consists of governmental professionals working to enhance IT accessibility across government. We also engage advocacy groups, industry, and academia to around innovative solutions for accessible technology.


## What we do
We identify and promote best practices for implementing the [Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Accessibility Standards](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh/final-rule/text-of-the-standards-and-guidelines). We share successful practices and information with each other. We use a diverse set of tools, from universal design to accessible development, to increase the accessibility of federal IT.
