Government contact centers are often the primary means of communication between an organization and its customers. In government, contact centers often set expectations for satisfaction and trust across the customer experience. Simply put, the voice of the organization and the customer is fostered through the contact center experience.

The Contact Center Community was founded for government contact center professionals to collaborate and improve the experience of citizens and customers when they contact federal, tribal, state, and local agencies.

## What We Do

Our mission is to share information and news, identify contact center best-in-class practices, and evaluate evolving contact center technologies.

The educational forums and discussions help members find innovative methods to improve the customer experience with their agency’s contact centers. Members share ideas, ask questions, and request assistance on their agency’s projects through our community Listserv. All federal, tribal, local, and state government employees and contractors working towards best-in-class contact centers are invited to join the community.

## Who We Are

We are a collaborative interagency group of contact center professionals working together to improve government contact centers' performance, experience, and efficiency across federal, tribal, state, and local agencies.
