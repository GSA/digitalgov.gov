The RPA Community of Practice (CoP) is charged with sharing solutions to help individual agencies overcome the technical, management, and operational challenges that arise in designing and deploying an effective RPA program. This includes important initiatives like designing common federal standards for credentialing, privacy, and security, and designing common management metrics to gauge government-wide impact of RPA.

## The RPA Playbook

This playbook is designed to provide federal agencies detailed, accessible guidance for initiating a new RPA program or rapidly evolving an existing program.

## Who We Are

The RPA CoP seeks to achieve its important mission with a sense of urgency and a bias towards action. As agencies continue to learn the potential benefits of RPA, enthusiasm for developing RPA programs government-wide grows exponentially. The RPA CoP plays an important role in helping agencies convert RPA enthusiasm into action. Specifically, the CoP helps agencies develop programs that are cost effective, auditable, avoid common pitfalls, and most importantly, deploy impactful automations.

The executive sponsors for the RPA Community of Practice are:

- **Gerard Badorrek** — General Services Administration Chief Financial Officer and RPA Community of Practice Chair
- **Anil Cheriyan** — General Services Administration Technology Transformation Services (TTS) Director

The RPA community and the RPA Playbook are coordinated by **Jim Geoghegan**: [james.geoghegan@gsa.gov](mailto:james.geoghegan@gsa.gov).

## What We Do

The community achieves its mission through information sharing, identification and definition of options, best practices, methods and standards for RPA implementation and operations. It does not set policy, but policy-setting agencies are encouraged to participate and make use of the community’s base of knowledge, information, and experience.
