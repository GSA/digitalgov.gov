**Your community managers**

## What We Do

The CoP achieves its mission through information sharing, identification and definition of options, best practices, methods and standards for RPA implementation and operations. The CoP does not set policy, but policy-setting agencies are encouraged to participate and make use of the community’s base of knowledge, information and experience.

### Practice areas

The CoP is organized by practice areas for distinct components of RPA program management. Each practice areas is led by a volunteer agency employee
- a practice Leader - and supported by practice area team - a group of agency volunteers.

All members are required to join at least one "practice area team" after their first meeting attended. This reflects the CoP’s principle that all contribute and all benefit.
