The robotic process automation (RPA) community of practice exists to bring together federal agencies that are interested in implementing RPA into their respective agencies. The CoP will share information and resources on the RPA process, collaborate and problem solve. This CoP is organized and coordinated by the General Services Administration (GSA).

## Join

The FedRPA CoP is open to government employees only.

## Who We Are

**Your community managers**

- Jim Geoghegan — Community of Practice Coordinator, [james.geoghegan@gsa.gov ](mailto:james.geoghegan@gsa.gov )
- Gerard Badorrek — GSA Chief Financial Officer, Executive Sponser and Acting Community of Practice Chair
- Anil Cheriyan — GSA Technology Transformation Services (TTS) Director, and Executive Sponser

## What We Do

The CoP achieves its mission through information sharing, identification and definition of options, best practices, methods and standards for RPA implementation and operations. The CoP does not set policy, but policy-setting agencies are encouraged to participate and make use of the community’s base of knowledge, information and experience.

### Practice areas

The CoP is organized by practice areas for distinct components of RPA program management. Each practice areas is led by a volunteer agency employee
- a practice Leader - and supported by practice area team - a group of agency volunteers.

All members are required to join at least one "practice area team" after their first meeting attended. This reflects the CoP’s principle that all contribute and all benefit.
