## Purpose

The RPA Community of Practice (CoP) helps individual agencies overcome the technical, management, and operational challenges that arise in designing and deploying an effective RPA program. This includes important initiatives like designing common federal standards for credentialing, ensuring privacy and security, and designing common management metrics to gauge RPA’s government-wide impact.

## What We Do

The CoP helps agencies convert RPA enthusiasm into action. Specifically, the CoP helps agencies develop programs that are cost-effective and auditable, avoid common pitfalls, and make a significant impact. The CoP hosts frequent knowledge-sharing events and publishes valuable guidance on best practices.

## Resources

The RPA community has built several resources, including an RPA Program [Playbook]({{< ref "rpa-playbook.md" >}}), an [Internal Controls Guide](https://digital.gov/pdf/rpa-playbook-ic-addendum-v1.0.pdf), and the [Federal Use Case Inventory]({{< ref "rpa-use-case-inventory.md" >}}). Check out our [RPA Guide]({{< ref "guides/rpa" >}}) to learn more!

## Who We Are  

The RPA CoP comprises  leaders across the federal government who share a passion for RPA.

**Gerard Badorrek** (General Services Administration (GSA)) Chief Financial Officer is the  RPA CoP Chair and executive sponsor.

Jim Geoghegan (GSA) manages the RPA community: [james.geoghegan@gsa.gov](mailto:james.geoghegan@gsa.gov).
