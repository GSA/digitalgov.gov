The RPA Community of Practice (CoP) is charged with sharing solutions to help individual agencies overcome the technical, management, and operational challenges that arise in designing and deploying an effective RPA program. This includes important initiatives like designing common federal standards for credentialing, privacy, and security, and designing common management metrics to gauge government-wide impact of RPA.

## Purpose

The RPA CoP seeks to achieve its important mission with a sense of urgency and a bias towards action. As agencies continue to learn the potential benefits of RPA, enthusiasm for developing RPA programs government-wide grows exponentially. The RPA CoP plays an important role in helping agencies convert RPA enthusiasm into action. Specifically, the CoP helps agencies develop programs that are cost effective, auditable, avoid common pitfalls, and most importantly, deploy impactful automations.

## What We Do

The CoP helps agencies convert RPA enthusiasm into action. Specifically, the CoP assists agencies in developing programs that are cost-effective, auditable, avoid common pitfalls, and most importantly, deploy impactful automations. To this end, the CoP hosts frequent knowledge-sharing events and publishes valuable guidance on best practices.

## Resources
The RPA community has gathered several resource which are available to anyone interested in becoming more familiar with Robotic Process Automation including a [Playbook]({{< ref "rpa-playbook.md" >}}) and [Use Case Inventory]({{< ref "rpa-use-case-inventory.md" >}}). Check out our [RPA Guide]({{< ref "guides/rpa" >}}) to learn more!
