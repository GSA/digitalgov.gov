We run meetings and trainings, engage in collaborative discussion, and send general emails with updates on new technology and trends.

## Who We Are

We’re government website analysts, developers, content strategists, user experience (UX) designers, communications professionals, or any and everyone else who use data to improve the public’s interaction with government sites.
