In government, those with analytics as part of their duties are faced with a fast-paced, ever-changing environment. Technologies, strategies, and tools change regularly. This community aims to uncover best practices, case studies, tips, and tools for web analytics and optimization.

## What We Do

We run meetings and trainings, engage in collaborative discussion, and send general emails with updates on new technology and trends.

## Who We Are

We’re government website analysts, developers, content strategists, user experience (UX) designers, communications professionals, or any and everyone else who use data to improve the public’s interaction with government sites.
