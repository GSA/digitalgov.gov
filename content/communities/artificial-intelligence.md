## Who We are

The Artificial Intelligence (AI) Community of Practice (CoP) unites federal employees who are active in, or interested in AI policy, technology, standards, and programs to accelerate the thoughtful adoption of AI across the federal government.

The AI CoP is being launched in coordination with the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO).

## What We Do

Our mission is to support the practical implementation of responsible AI in the federal government. The AI CoP brings federal employees together to:

- facilitate the sharing of best practices, use cases, and lessons learned, and
- advance and share tools, playbooks success stories with a community of interested professionals.

**Events and Huddles**

The AI CoP regularly organizes and runs events and series on high-priority AI topics for a federal-wide audience to promote key stakeholder AI efforts and case studies through presentations. Examples of these events include:

- AI + Acquisition Event Series
- AI + Privacy Event Series
- Inclusive AI Event
- Chatbots Event

Additionally, the AI CoP hosts monthly huddles to connect AI leaders, practitioners, and researchers with one another through an open forum. Materials for all previous events and huddle can be found by visiting our [Artificial Intelligence Community of Practice MAX.gov page](https://community.max.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2172176006).
