---

Next generation digital public services are powered by government data and artificial intelligence like chatbots and smart forms. The intelligent automation of programs helps make our public services more open, responsive, informative, and accessible for the American people.

## Who we are
This community aims to unite public service managers in evaluating and building smart automation solutions.

## How to Join

**If you are a government employee** with a .gov or .mil email address, join our [Federal Artificial Intelligence Community](mailto:AI-subscribe-request@listserv.gsa.gov?subject=AI%20listserv).


## What We Do
We launched an open-source pilot that helped dozens of federal programs make their services available to consumer intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) like Amazon Alexa, Microsoft Cortana, Google Assistant, and Facebook Messenger. We’re working with client agencies to prepare business cases understanding the impact of these advances in Artificial Intelligence.
