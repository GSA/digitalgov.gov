## Who We are

This community aims to unite federal employees who are active in, or interested in AI policy, technology, standards, and programs to accelerate the thoughtful adoption of AI across the federal government.

The AI CoP is being launched in coordination with the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO).

## What We Do

The AI CoP will bring together federal employees to:

- facilitate the sharing of best practices, use cases, and lessons learned, and
- advance and share tools, playbooks success stories with a community of interested professionals.
