If you manage a U.S. government website, or write digital content for your agency, this group is for you! Discussion topics cover content strategy, accessibility, customer experience, plain language, and more.

## Overview

We’ve been working together since late 2000 to improve the content and usability of U.S. government websites. The Web Content Managers Forum is a community of government employees who share ideas, challenges, lessons learned, and best practices in managing the content of government websites.

## Who we are

Join us if you are an employee of a federal, state, or local U.S. government agency, working on government digital content.

## What we do

Knowledge Sharing: This listserv provides you with a platform to ask and answer questions of your digital content management peers. You can share news, findings, results, hurdles and collaborate on issues related to manage government digital content.
