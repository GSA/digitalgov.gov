We are a group for federal, tribal, state, and local government employees who manage government websites and digital services. We are working to create a trusted, seamless online experience for all.

## What We Do

Together, everyone achieves more. We recognize the expert in each of us. Our primary purpose is to collaborate and share ideas, challenges, lessons learned, and best practices in managing government websites and digital services.

We support efforts to implement the [21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act](https://digital.gov/resources/21st-century-integrated-digital-experience-act/) (21st Century IDEA) and other requirements for government websites and digital services.

We meet several times a year and maintain an active LISTSERV. We also work with other [communities of practice](https://digital.gov/communities) and the [Federal Web Council](https://digital.gov/resources/federal-web-council/) to publish case studies, blog posts, and other resources on Digital.gov.

## Who We Are

We held our [first community meeting in October 2000](https://web.archive.org/web/20010609224356/http://www.hud.gov/library/bookshelf15/webcontentmgr.cfm). The web content managers group was started as a way for content managers, not techies, to get together to discuss web content and management issues facing the federal government. We have evolved over the past 20 years to include everyone who has a role in building websites and digital services.
