## Who we are

The A/B Testing Community of Practice started with the team at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau about three years ago - we were so inspired by what weâ€™d learned from our own tests that we wanted to share with other federal agencies, and see what we could learn from case studies outside CFPB. We are driven to foster a group that can share their experiences and learn from one another.


## What we do

The A/B Testing Community of Practice meets once a quarter to discuss the latest in the A/B testing world. We invite guest speakers, share case studies, explore new tools, and provide support for new and current members trying to grow their A/B testing practice and knowledge.
