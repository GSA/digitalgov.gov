## What we do

The A/B Testing Community of Practice organizes meetings to discuss the latest in A/B testing. We invite guest speakers, share case studies, explore new tools, and provide support for new and current members trying to grow their A/B testing practice and knowledge.

## Who we are

The A/B Testing Community of Practice started with a team at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), circa 2016. We were inspired by what weâ€™d learned from our own tests that, and see what we could learn from case studies outside CFPB. We are driven to foster a group that can share their experiences and learn from one another.
