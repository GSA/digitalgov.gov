## Who we are

The A/B Testing Community of Practice started with the team at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), circa 2016. We were so inspired by what we’d learned from our own tests that we wanted to share with other federal agencies, and see what we could learn from case studies outside CFPB. We are driven to foster a group that can share their experiences and learn from one another.


## What we do

The A/B Testing Community of Practice meets once a quarter to discuss the latest in the A/B testing world. We invite guest speakers, share case studies, explore new tools, and provide support for new and current members trying to grow their A/B testing practice and knowledge.
