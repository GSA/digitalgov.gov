Digital.gov, a service of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), manages several [communities of practice](https://digital.gov/communities/) for government employees and contractors. We manage these communities to fulfill [our mission](https://digital.gov/about/), which includes making open collaboration across government easier. We host events, host community mailing lists, and publish content to facilitate conversations among community members.

{{< note variant="join" >}}
All federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial government employees and contractors are eligible to join our communities. You must use your official government email account, in most cases a .gov or .mil account.
{{< /note >}}

We strive to maintain inclusive, professional communities that engage in on-topic discussions. By voluntarily participating in these communities, you are agreeing to abide by these guidelines and the [TTS code of conduct](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/about-us/code-of-conduct/). If you do not agree, email us at [digitalgov@gsa.gov](mailto:digitalgov@gsa.gov), and we will unsubscribe you from the LISTSERV mailing lists.

When GSA becomes aware of alleged violations of the guidelines or code of conduct, we use a fair, objective process to review and evaluate the incident and determine an appropriate course of action. In accordance with GSA’s policies and legal guidance, the Digital.gov team implements this process in consultation with a community’s GSA lead and GSA’s human resources team and general counsel.

Courses of action include:
* taking no action,
* sending a reminder for infractions, and
* issuing a first or second notice for violations.

Severe or repeated violations may result in temporary or permanent removal from the communities.

Email us at [digitalgov@gsa.gov](mailto:digitalgov@gsa.gov) to report an alleged violation.

## Your communications are not private

As a federal agency, GSA is subject to records access requests such as the [Freedom of Information Act](https://www.gsa.gov/reference/freedom-of-information-act-foia) (FOIA). We must comply with requests for records made under FOIA. All communications made on the mailing lists are subject to release under FOIA.

## Follow the ground rules

We all have a responsibility to ensure the community is a safe space for everyone and free from harassment. It is appropriate to have and express differing opinions, as long as they are expressed in a respectful manner.

When dealing with sensitive topics or during disagreements, written statements can often sound more aggressive than when we speak them out loud. Review your message before pressing send. Think about how it may appear to its recipients. Remember, each message goes to thousands of people. When in doubt, don’t send it out.

Words matter. Choose words that create a safe, inclusive, respectful, and welcoming environment. Take a look at the following resources on inclusive language for additional information.

* [Inclusive language](https://content-guide.18f.gov/our-style/inclusive-language/) - 18F Content Guide
* [Preferred terms for select population groups and communities](https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/Preferred_Terms.html) - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
