GSA supports many communities of practice by hosting listservs which provide our DigitalGov community with an easy way to collaborate, ask questions, and share information.

The handy tips that follow will help you manage your GSA listserv subscription. Confirm that your community’s list is hosted by GSA by checking that the email address ends in “@listserv.gsa.gov”. If you still have questions after reading this page, contact your community/listserv manager.

Note that these instructions reference a sample listserv called _TESTLIST@listserv.gsa.gov_. Just substitute the name of YOUR listserv (e.g., _CONTENT-MANAGERS-L_@listserv.gsa.gov) whenever you see _TESTLIST_, to apply these instructions to your listserv.

### How to Join a Listserv

Government employees (with a .gov or .mil email address) are encouraged to join any communities of practice that relate to your work. [Visit our Communities page]({{< link "communities.md" >}}) to see all the communities and learn how to join.

### General Etiquette

When sending a message to the entire listserv, consider that your message is going to hundreds or even thousands of people. It’s usually better to respond directly to someone, rather than sending your message to the entire list (e.g., use REPLY vs. REPLY ALL). But if your message or question is intended for the full community—by all means—send it to the full list. We want to keep listservs manageable and relevant, and we’ve seen people unsubscribe when lists get too busy. But we also don’t want to stifle frank, open conversation, which is what the listserv is all about, so please use your best judgement when deciding whether to REPLY or REPLY ALL.

### How to Send a Message

Any listserv member can send a message to the group by using this email address:

**_[Name of YOUR listserv]_@listserv.gsa.gov**, (e.g., _CONTENT-MANAGERS-L_@listserv.gsa.gov).

Some lists distribute your message immediately, while others are configured to ask you to verify your message before it’s distributed to the list. This is to reduce viruses and spam on the listserv.

To verify a message for distribution:

  * Click the link in the confirmation email you receive from the listserv. The link will look similar to this: “To APPROVE the message: https://listserv.gsa.gov/cgi-bin/wa.exe?OK=A307E2C&L=_TESTLIST_“

**OR**

  * REPLY to the confirmation email message
  * Type the word “OK”—without the quotes—in the body of the message
  * Erase all other text in the body of the message, including signature blocks, then send

Note, some email systems have trouble processing the link, so try the “OK” method described above if the “click” option doesn’t work for you.

### Common Listserv Commands

Following are some of the common commands available to you as a listserv subscriber. Common commands include subscribing to a daily digest (instead of receiving each message individually), unsubscribing, or resetting your subscription to the default settings.

When using these commands, always:

  * Send the command in an email message addressed to: **listserv@listserv.gsa.gov**
  * Type the command in the body of the message, on one line (not in the subject line—the subject line should be left blank)
  * Remove any other text from the body of your message, including signature blocks

### “Out of Office” Messages

Think of the listserv when setting “out of office” messages. Create a rule to either avoid sending “out of office” message to listserv groups, or only send an “out of office” to people who’ve directly sent you a personal email. Ask your IT staff if you need help with this.

If you do get “Out of Office” messages from fellow listserv members who forget, you can set up your email software to filter out messages that have “Out of Office” in the subject line. Consult with your IT support staff to see how to filter these messages, since the steps may vary, depending on your email program.

  Access the Listserv Archive
</h2>

Listserv members can access a searchable, browsable online archive of previous messages. To access the listserv archives, first [register a password](https://listserv.gsa.gov/cgi-bin/wa.exe?GETPW1). After you register, you will receive an auto-confirm email. Follow the instructions in that email to complete your registration and receive a password.

Once you have your password, you can [login to the archive](https://listserv.gsa.gov/cgi-bin/wa.exe?LOGON) to search the listserv archives by keyword, browse the listserv archives by month, or modify your listserv subscription settings.
