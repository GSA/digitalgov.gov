The Federal Community of Practice on Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science (FedCCS) works across the government to share lessons learned and develop best practices for designing, implementing, and evaluating crowdsourcing and citizen science initiatives.

## Community Managers

The FedCCS Co-Chairs are:

Jay Benforado, Deputy Chief Innovation Officer, Office of Research and Development, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

Sophia B. Liu, Innovation Specialist, Science and Decisions Center, U.S. Geological Survey  (USGS)

John McLaughlin, Education Program Manager, Office of Education, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)

## Overview

The FedCCS seeks to expand and improve the U.S. government’s use of crowdsourcing, citizen science, and similar public participation techniques for the purpose of enhancing agency mission, scientific, and societal outcomes. The CCS seeks to create a nurturing ecosystem for federally supported services, the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines, and sciences that draw on public participation and partnership. You can learn more about the activities of this community in this [two-page overview document](https://digital.gov/pdf/FedCCS.pdf).

## Who we are

The community is open to all federal practitioners working on, funding, or just interested in learning more about crowdsourcing and citizen science.

## What we do

The community meets on the last Thursday of every month from 2:30 – 4:30 pm E.T., hosted by member agencies. The community also shares resources and discusses specific topics of interest via conversations on the listserv.
