The Agile/Lean Community of Practice was started to bring together federal employees who are currently working with agile/lean methodologies or would like to learn more about Agile/Lean. We believe that agile/lean concepts can help the federal government become more efficient and effective while delivering better public services to the American citizen.

## Community Managers

Logan Powell (Census) and Dr. Bill Brantley (USPTO)

## Who We Are

We are a diverse community of project managers, developers, agency leaders, and other public servants who want to improve organizational processes while becoming more personally effective in their work.

## What we do

The Agile/Lean Community of Practice has three goals:

1. To share best practices and case studies of successful agile/lean projects in the federal agencies.
2. To provide learning opportunities through unconferences, webinars, and other training to help increase the adoption of agile/lean methodologies in government.
3. To serve as a voice for the Agile/Lean federal government community.
