We are a community of federal government developers, managers, and individuals interested in open source software. We support the implementation of the [Federal Source Code Policy](https://sourcecode.cio.gov/) (OMB Memo M-16-21) and associated technology platform, [Code.gov](https://code.gov/).

## What we do

We help answer questions and offer solutions concerning open source software. We support keeping Code.gov current with federal source code and content for working with open source code.

## Who we are

We are developers and open source experts, dedicated to helping you with any questions or concerns you may have about open source in the federal government. Curious about something regarding open source software or Code.gov? Ask us.
