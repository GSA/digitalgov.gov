title: Plain Language Community of Practice
---

Our goal is to promote the use of plain language for all government communications. We believe that using plain language will save federal agencies time and money and provide better customer service to the public.

And it’s the law: The [Plain Writing Act of 2010](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-111publ274/pdf/PLAW-111publ274.pdf) (PDF, 125 KB) mandates plain language for certain audiences and tasks.

### **About this Group**

The Plain Language Action and Information Network (PLAIN) Community of Practice (PL-COP) is an inter-agency group of plain language practitioners from many different federal government agencies and specialties who support the use of clear communication in government writing.

PL-COP is administered by the [Plain Language Action and Information Network (PLAIN)](http://www.plainlanguage.gov/).
