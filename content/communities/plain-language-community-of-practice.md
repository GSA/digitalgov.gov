The Plain Language Action and Information Network (PLAIN) is a community of federal employees dedicated to the idea that citizens deserve clear communications from government. We believe that using plain language saves federal agencies time and money and provides better service to the American public.

## What We Do

Throughout the year, PLAIN provides free [plain language training](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/training/) to federal staff and hosts plain-language related events such as monthly meetings and our annual summit.  Our community offers support and answers to members’ questions.

To be notified about PLAIN activities and new resources, sign up for the PL-COP.

## Who We Are

We’re a group of  plain language practitioners from federal government agencies and the public, with varying specialties and different levels of expertise.
