We are a community of Federal government employees who support each other as we learn, share, and adopt innovative approaches and new ways of working within our organizations.

* Collaborate with each other to create real change by sharing questions, stories, and advice.
* Connect with new, practicing, and expert intrapreneurs in government.
* Shift your mindset around failure, how we work, and whatâ€™s possible.
* Learn to leverage available tools and technologies, including shared solutions.

## Who We Are

We are any federal employee who has ever struggled to bring about big or small changes to improve government programs and services. Our diverse community welcomes people from any job series, grade level, or location across the government.
