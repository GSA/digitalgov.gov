## Who we are

Our community consist of grants managers from federal, state, and local government, tribes, researchers, non-profits, and academia, who steward over $700 billion in grants funding through more than 1,800 diverse federal grants programs. We engage public and private stakeholders to develop best practices that modernize grants management, and to balance compliance requirements with results.

## What we do

{{< img src="presidents-managment-agenda" >}}

Federal grants touch every aspect of the American economy. From funding research, to advancing education, housing and infrastructure programs, federal grants stimulate growth that moves our nation forward.

This community will offer a space for you to discuss common challenges and solutions surrounding federal grants – whether you administer funds from inside the federal government or are from an external organization that receives federal funds.

As the [President’s Management Agenda](https://www.performance.gov/PMA/) (PMA) seeks to drive more [results-oriented accountability for grants](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/CAP_goal_8.html) across federal agencies, this community will enable you to ask questions, enter into discussions, and propose innovative solutions with people across local, federal, state and tribal governments, higher education and research institutions, nonprofits and more.
