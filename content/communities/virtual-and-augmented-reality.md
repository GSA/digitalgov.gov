summary: "A collaborative hub for the research and refinement of VR and AR business cases and pilot programs across government."

Immersive enhanced audio and visual experiences through virtual and augmented reality are now available to many U.S. citizens through smartphones and other mobile devices, opening the door to an incredible diversity of new programs and services.

## How to join

If you are a government employee with a .gov or .mil email address, [join our Virtual and Augmented Reality Community](mailto:VR-subscribe-request@listserv.gsa.gov?subject=VR%20listserv).

This community serves as a collaborative hub for the research and refinement of VR and AR business cases and pilot programs across government.

Federal agencies are eager to share their ideas on how this new medium might expand and improve their services â€“ using virtual therapy to treat PTSD, educating farmers on the installation of solar panels, or disaster management preparedness and response. To help explore and share these great ideas, we host workshops where agencies and industry specialists can brainstorm and demonstrate the new technologies.
