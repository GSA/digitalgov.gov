## Do your images have descriptive alt text?

### Why it’s important
- Carmen’s page didn’t load all the way and didn’t get to download the images. 
- Amanda is blind and uses a braille reader to understand the contents of images. 
- John is looking for information with a search engine and needs help being directed to the right content (descriptive alt tags will improve search).

### Steps to take
- Include meaningful information describing each image in the alt text.
- Use an empty alt attribute when text describing the image is already on the page.
- Don’t start the alt text with Image of or Photo of – the screen reader already announces that images are images.
- If the image is decorative and you don’t want the screen reader to announce it at all, use  null (empty) alt text (`alt=""`).
