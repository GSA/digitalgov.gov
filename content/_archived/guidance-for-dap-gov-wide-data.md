On August 17th, Steve VanRoekel, U.S. Chief Information Officer, sent a memo to the CIO Council that stated beginning Aug 29, 2014, access to all [Digital Analytics Program (DAP)]({{< link "/dap/" >}} "DAP: Digital Analytics Program") data government-wide will be rolled out to all participating DAP agency users. That means that DAP users will have access not only to their specific agency&#8217;s profile/view, but all of the participating agencies&#8217; views, as well as the government-wide main roll-up profile.

As the memo stated, &#8220;opening the DAP government-wide data will let participating agencies see other agency’s public-facing website analytics, gain valuable knowledge about shared customers, benchmark against similar agencies, and, most importantly, engage in collaboration and exchange lessons learned.&#8221;

## DAP Gov-Wide Access Usage Information

* Will there be training on how to best leverage the gov-wide data under DAP?
    * Yes. We plan on hosting ongoing training for all DAP users to demonstrate how the government-wide reporting templates work, and discuss the authorization of government-wide data in general. Trainings are posted on [DigitalGov.gov]({{< link "events" >}}), [DAP User Online Community on Yammer](https://www.yammer.com/dapusergrouponlineforum/), and communicated to DAP users via the DAP listserv.
* Can I talk publicly about other agencies&#8217; data?
    * No. Please see the [DAP User Agreement]({{< link "common-questions-about-dap.md#part-7" >}}).
* Can I use analytics data from other agencies’ websites to inform changes/modifications to my agency’s websites?
    * Yes. The goal of the DAP user access to the government-wide reporting is to allow everyone to use the data to create better and more engaging digital experiences for the public.
* Based on data I see in the government-wide reporting, can I contact other agencies to partner or coordinate programs/online content?
    * Yes. We would love to see Web managers from multiple agencies communicating about content, design, strategy, and anything else the data can uncover.
* Can we say things like “The #1 Visited Government Website” to boost our brand?
    * No. While we encourage all agencies to use the data to its fullest potential, currently, no information that isn’t _specific_ to your agency should be discussed publicly; and even in that case, any public discussion of metrics is at each agency’s discretion.
* How can I most efficiently use this data?
    * We hope to see agencies creating analyses that can track, for instance, where the public is going to search for information on a specific topic, and use it to streamline the overall website experience. Another example of the data use is to improve mobile capabilities of Web properties if the agency’s websites are lagging behind the government-wide trend in mobile usage. See the reporting templates below to get started.
