The Web Content Managers listserv is open to content managers from any level of U.S. government: federal, state, local, and tribal. Since the purpose of this group is to exchange ideas amongst U.S. government Web practitioners, we do not admit contractors or other private individuals. Learn more about the [Web Content Managers Forum]({{< ref "web-managers-forum.md" >}} "Web Content Managers Forum").

### Join

If you’d like to join the Forum email [Alycia Piazza](mailto:alycia.piazza@gsa.gov). If you are a U.S. government employee, we&#8217;ll automatically subscribe you to the Content Managers listserv within 2-3 business days.

### How to Send a Message

Any listserv member can send a message to the group by using this email address:

<CONTENT-MANAGERS-L@listserv.gsa.gov>

Once you send the message, you&#8217;ll be asked to verify your original message before it&#8217;s distributed to the list. This is to reduce viruses and spam on the listserv.

To verify a message for distribution:

  1. REPLY to the confirmation email message
  2. Type the word &#8220;OK&#8221;—without the quotes—in the body of the message
  3. Leave off any other text in the body of the message, including signature blocks

OR

* Click the link provided in the email message.
* The link will appear similar to this:  &#8220;To APPROVE the message: [https://listserv.gsa.gov/cgi-bin/wa.exe?OK=A3042E6C&L=CONTENT-MANAGERS-L](https://listserv.gsa.gov/cgi-bin/wa.exe?OK=A307E2C&L=CONTENT-MANAGERS-L)

### General Etiquette

When sending a message to the entire listserv, consider that your message is going to more than 2,000 people. If you have a suggestion or a response to the person who sent the original message, you should email that person directly rather than sending your message to the entire list. But if your message or question is intended for the full community—by all means—send it to the full list. We want to keep the listserv manageable and relevant. But we also don&#8217;t want to stifle frank, open conversation, which is what the listserv is all about.

### &#8220;Out of Office&#8221; Messages

Think of the listserv when setting &#8220;out of office&#8221; messages. Create a rule to either avoid sending &#8220;out of office&#8221; message to listserv groups, or only send an &#8220;out of office&#8221; to people who&#8217;ve directly sent you a personal email. Ask your IT staff if you need help with this.

If you do get &#8220;Out of Office&#8221; messages from people who forget, you can set up your email software to filter out messages that have &#8220;Out of Office&#8221; in the subject line. Consult with your IT support staff to see how to filter these messages, since the steps may vary, depending on your email program.

### Common Listserv Commands

Following are some of the common commands you can use as a subscriber of this listserv. Common commands include subscribing to a daily digest (instead of receiving each message individually), unsubscribing, or resetting your subscription to the default settings.

When using these commands, always:

* Send the command in an email message addressed to:  [**listserv@listserv.gsa.gov**](mailto:listserv@listserv.gsa.gov)
* Type the command in the body of the message, on one line (not in the subject line—the subject line should be left blank)
* Remove any other text from the body of your message, including signature blocks
