Note that, as of June 2011, a freeze is in effect on issuing new .gov domains for Federal Executive Branch agencies. See [OMB Guidance on Streamlining Service Delivery and Improving Customer Service](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2011/m11-24.pdf) (PDF, 2.3 MB, 6 pages, June 2011) for background. The freeze was extended indefinitely by the Federal CIO on January 1, 2012, and is still in effect while OMB reviews new guidance to formalize the “no new .gov domains” policy.

If you receive a request to stand up a new website for your agency (e.g., “www.newsite.gov”), you should work with the requesting program manager to incorporate the new content into an existing Web property, perhaps by establishing a sub-site in a domain you already own (e.g., “www.agency.gov/newsite” or “newsite.agency.gov”).

Your agency can realize significant savings (sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars) in website hosting, development and maintenance costs, by incorporating new content into your existing Web infrastructure. It&#8217;s also easier to manage the content as part of your Department&#8217;s overall content strategy. Follow this same practice even for cross-agency efforts, since the public won&#8217;t really care which agency hosts the content, as long as they can see it&#8217;s on a .gov domain.

## Waivers

Until the freeze is lifted, your agency can request a waiver from OMB to stand up a new domain, if you can demonstrate a real business need.

Until OMB releases the new .gov domain policy, your agency may submit a domain waiver request through OMB MAX, in the &#8220;Dot Gov Domain Procedures&#8221; section. If your agency is granted a waiver to establish a new or &#8220;vanity&#8221; domain (e.g., www.newsite.gov), the content should be hosted on an existing website (e.g., www.agency.gov/newsite), and the vanity URL should redirect to the existing website.

For background, read this Whitehouse.gov blog post about [Too Many Websites](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/06/13/toomanywebsitesgov), which explains the reasoning behind the freeze on issuing new .gov domains.

## About Dot Gov Domains

Federal agencies are required to host digital content on .gov, .mil, or .fed.us domains. The use of these domains is restricted to U.S. government agencies, and helps the public identify official government websites. One exception: if an agency head explicitly determines another domain is necessary for the proper performance of an agency function (this is rare).

Policies related to .gov domains include:

* [OMB Policies for Federal Public Websites](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/fy2005/m05-04.pdf) (PDF, 48 KB, 5 pages, December 2004)—requires agencies to “Use Approved Domains”
* [.GOV Internet Program Guidelines](https://www.dotgov.gov/portal/web/dotgov/program-guidelines)—overview of domain registration requirements
* [.GOV Internet Domain Guidelines](https://www.dotgov.gov/portal/web/dotgov/domain-guidelines)—guidance for agency domain management
* Final Rule &#8211; 41 [CFR Part 102-173](https://www.dotgov.gov/portal/web/dotgov/policy)—authorizes GSA to manage the .gov registration process
* [Prohibition on lobbying with appropriated moneys](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2012-title18/pdf/USCODE-2012-title18-partI-chap93-sec1913.pdf) (Title 18, Section 1913, U.S. Code)—federal public websites must not be used for direct or indirect lobbying
