The Digital Analytics Program (DAP) offers advanced, easy Web analytics to federal agencies. The program is a hosted shared service provided by <a href="http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/25729" target="_blank">GSA&#8217;s Technology Transformation Service</a>.Â On November 8, 2016, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a memorandum on <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2017/m-17-06.pdf" target="_blank">Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites and Digital Services</a>, which requires federal agencies to implement the DAP javascript code on all public facing federal websites.

The program consists of:

  * A no-cost, federal-wide Web analytics tool
  * Training 
      * Past recorded trainings on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLd9b-GuOJ3nFwlyvLFUtmDpYFKezhot8P" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>
      * Future training found on our [events page](https://www.digitalgov.gov/events/)
  * Implementation support 
      * [DAP FAQs](https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/common-questions-about-dap-faq/)

      * Most recent code available in the <a href="https://github.com/digital-analytics-program/gov-wide-code" target="_blank">DAP Github repo</a>
  * [On-going help-desk](mailto:dap@support.digitalgov.gov) and data reporting support

## Benefits and Features

### No-cost, hosted website analytics

  * Provides comprehensive, easy-to-use analytics for every section of your online presence.
  * Delivers broad overviews and in-depth insights that apply to programs across your agency.
  * Scalable to handle a broad range of .gov sites (large and small).
  * Allows instantaneous access to a targeted set of critical performance data.
  * Meets agency compliance with OMB reporting on theÂ 10 Minimum Common Baseline Performance Metrics for [Milestone 8.2](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/2012/10/8_2_DGS_Implementation_Instructions_v_final.docx).
  * Hosted service by GSA avoids duplication of agencies purchasing the same tool and going through separate procurements.

### Quick, reliable, and secure infrastructure

  * Delivers instant analytics for up-to-the minute site awareness.
  * GSA&#8217;s signed Terms of Service agreement provides legal framework for using the tool.

### Data insights across agencies

  * Using a common analytics tool across federal agencies will deliver [an unprecedented, government-wide view](https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/guidance-for-dap-gov-wide-data/ "Guidance for DAP Gov-Wide Data") of how well agencies serve their customers through the Web.
  * Participation from 45 agencies offers data from a variety of types of websites within government. See agency participation at <a href="https://pulse.cio.gov/" target="_blank">pulse.cio.gov</a>.
  * Making analytic data more accessible will create new possibilities for agencies to collaborate to improve services.

## Participating in the Program

Any federal agency can sign up to use the common Web analytics tool. Here&#8217;s how it works:

  * Agencies define a DAP point of contact (POC).
  * GSA will send the agency POC a short, sign-up form to register their agency and work with them to implement the common page tag code.
  * GSA will provide implementation support, access to training, and other resources to agency POCs.
  * If you don&#8217;t have an identified POC,Â [send us an email](mailto:dap@support.digitalgov.gov).

## Gaining access to DAP

If your agency participates in the program, you can request access to the data by [emailing us](mailto:dap@support.digitalgov.gov). We&#8217;ll send you instructions and a short registration form, and notify your agency POC. After you complete the form, we&#8217;ll grant you access and get you started!
