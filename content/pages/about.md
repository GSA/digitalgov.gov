We live in aÂ time whenÂ [more pre-schoolers can use a smartphone app than can tie their shoes](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/01/preschoolers-better-at-navigating-iphone-than-tying-their-shoes/). How does government prepareÂ to meet the information needs of these budding citizens?Â **DigitalGovÂ** means providing information and services to the public anywhere andÂ anytime.

This site is a platform to help those inÂ agencies working onÂ providing digital services and information for the public. We&#8217;ll scourÂ the innerwebs for digital info so you donâ€™t have to. Expect posts on what government is doing in digital, general digital news, trends and issues on implementing digital for the public.
