<li style="margin-bottom: 15px">
  <b>Divide and conquer: </b>Keep projects simple: if you have a big project, consider dividing it into smaller tasks. You can also offer several tasks at the same time (rather than sequentially). <ul>
    <li>
      In order to create the Federal Crowdsource Mobile Testing Program, the Mobile team posted a 20 percent task to help plan and create the program. Once the program was up and running, the team created two additional opportunities: one to manage the program and a second to run individual test cycles. Multiple test cycles can be advertised on Open Opps at the same time.
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 15px">
  <b>Be specific: </b>Define exactly what needs to be done and what deliverables you expect. Include links or documents that the participant will need. <ul>
    <li>
      The DigitalGov team <a href="https://openopps.digitalgov.gov/tasks/25">needed a writer</a> who could contribute to a weekly blog series. The task included <a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/tag/trends-on-tuesday/">a link to the blog series</a> so that potential participants could get familiar with existing articles.
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 15px">
  <b>Give the big picture: </b>Include information on how participants‚Äô work will/may be used. This helps participants understand their work is part of a greater effort. <ul>
    <li>
      The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) <a href="https://openopps.digitalgov.gov/tasks/24">needed facts sheets updated</a>. For their task, they explained that the fact sheets would be posted on their website and would ¬ ‚Äúhelp the world understand the importance of the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation at NIST.‚Äù
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 15px">
  <b>Know your own availability: </b>Remember that you are an active part of Open Opps: the more clarity you provide, the less ‚Äòback and forth‚Äô you will need to do in the future with participants. If you are submitting a 20%er task, ensure that you are able to invest time supporting participants for the duration of your project.
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px">
  <b>A title is more than words: </b>Write a catchy title (BUT also make sure it‚Äôs clear and descriptive!). <ul>
    <li>
      Every task can have a catchy title. ‚Äú<a href="http://gsablogs.gsa.gov/dsic/2013/05/07/help-us-tell-the-story-about-a-nih-rockstar-who-is-creating-modular-on-the-go-content/">Help Us Tell the Story of an NIH Rockstar</a>‚Äù catches more attention than ‚ÄúInterview an Employee of NIH.‚Äù
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 15px">
  <b>Focus on skills, not job titles:</b> Participants may skip over opportunities if they do not identify with a particular job title. A skill list will self-populate as you create your task. Use that skill list to guide your task description. <ul>
    <li>
      For example: ‚ÄúI need someone with strong data analysis skills in Excel‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúI need someone with experience as a Research Assistant.‚Äù
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 15px">
  <b>Drop jargon: </b>Write your tasks in plain language. Use full office names rather than acronyms. Avoid using office-specific slang. Define complicated terms or include links to relevant resources that will help participants understand the task.
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px">
  <b>Set realistic timelines: </b>Participants may not be familiar with your office or agency. Does your task require background knowledge that may take a variable amount of time for the participant to research, depending on learning styles?
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px">
  <b>Every Open Opp is a learning opportunity. </b>Many tasks do not require participants to be experts in a given field. If you are looking for somebody who is willing to learn a new skill, clearly state that. <ul>
    <li>
      The DigitalGov usability team requested help with <a href="https://openopps.digitalgov.gov/tasks/18">writing usability case studies</a>. They clearly stated that using WordPress was part of the task, but they would accept a participant who was willing to learn WordPress basics.
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom: 15px">
  <b>Market your Open Opp</b>. Are there communities of practice (CoP‚Äôs) that might be interested in your task? Use our <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/2015/04/Open-Opps-Marketing-Email-Template-for-CoPs.docx">Open Opps Marketing Email Template for CoPs</a> (14 kb MS Word .docx) to craft a message. <ul>
    <li>
      Want to target an individual (or six?) Each task has a ‚Äúshare‚Äù button that produces a pre-populated email template.
