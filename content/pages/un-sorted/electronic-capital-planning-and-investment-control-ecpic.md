## Benefits & Features

The Electronic Capital Planning and Investment Control (eCPIC) application is a web-based, Government-owned technology solution that Federal Agencies use to support their internal Portfolio Management, IT Capital Planning, and IT Governance processes and also to meet their external reporting requirements to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). eCPIC was developed to address agency needs for a more organized and transparent approach to IT Capital Planning. It was conceived on the principles that agencies should work together to improve the maturity of IT Governance and IT Capital Planning across the Federal government. GSA has led the dedicated eCPIC Program Management Office (PMO) since 2009, but all functional enhancements and service offerings are driven by the community of Agencies that use the tool.

Joining the eCPIC community is more than just purchasing a tool. It is joining a collaboration of cross-Government practitioners who all work together to help agencies mature their IT CPIC practices and support their missions through better IT decisions. The FESCOM meets monthly to talk about IT Capital Planning and IT Governance best practices, lessons learned, and tool development and enhancement. 15 of the 24 (62.5%) CFO Act agencies as well as 4 non-CFO Act Agencies use eCPIC to make data driven decisions and to improve their internal IT Governance practices. Due to the size and composition of our community, we are often called on by OMB to help shape federal IT policy. This positions our members in the best possible place to be able to mature their internal IT Capital Planning and IT Governance processes, as well as influence external government-wide IT policy.
