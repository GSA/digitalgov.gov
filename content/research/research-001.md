#### Q1 / October 2017

Starting in early 2017, the DigitalGov team made a commitment to conducting ongoing user-research as part of its mission to support the people in government responsible for modernizing technology and delivering efficient, effective public services.

Each of our research sprints will start with a statement of what we’re setting out to learn, and finish with a report written to benefit and inform the wider community of thinkers, problem solvers, technologists, and tinkerers in government.


### Who are these people?

These people work in areas of communication, innovation, design, development—they are involved with all aspects of the digital delivery services.

Most of them have been in government for more than five years, some as contractors and some as feds who have worked at more than one agency during their careers.

Some of them have access to tools and resources they need, but don’t have time to dig deeply into areas of interest, while others wear many hats or do whatever’s needed, but have to get creative to access the tools they need.

Some would like to have a seat at the table to better influence the work that gets done at their agencies, while others just want assurance they are doing their job correctly.

Some work at agencies so risk averse, they feel their job is to launch tools that don’t endanger the agency.

Many admire the work of  similar agencies who seem to be working smarter, and find examples of other feds succeeding the most effective tools for change.

They all want to be better connected to the larger government community, as not all the guidance or information trickles down—or out—to their spaces. They want to learn more, do more.

The following are short personas into who

1. I provide internal communications support for agency communicators, including social media. I’ve been at my agency nearly 10 years, but want to learn more. I want to know how to raise visibility of my agency’s work. I look up to other agencies doing similar work and follow lots of blogs/resources.
2. I oversee an innovation team at my agency, so I see the value in government-specific information. I also wear many hats, and have no budget. I’m looking for areas I can demonstrate small wins. I want to know how other agencies have had success saving time or modernizing processes. I’m looking for open source tools and new ways of working, as many people in my agency are bound to old rules. Twitter is the main way I stay up to date.
3. I am a digital communications manager at a field office in my agency. I look to other agencies as having more skills in certain areas, like social media. I want more information on what we should be measuring, government-wide. I think it would be beneficial to sign one Terms of Service for all of the federal government.
4. I manage the communications branch in my agency. We are a small team and anything that goes online goes through us first. We are trying to standardize practices at our agency.
5. I am an external and internal communications manager, which includes social media, for my agency. I supervise a team. We are not as sophisticated as a similar agency, but are able to make advances technologically when given clearance from agency leadership. We have a weekly call with all bureaus to find out what the agency head is up to. I am interested in change/modernization of government.
6. I am a designer/developer with Drupal. I do graphics and content for the website at my agency. We are currently going thru a content migration. I want to be more open to the public and continually test our site. I like feeling a part of the larger government community and staying connected. But, I don’t have time to read lots. I want to be compliant with the baseline—make sure I’m doing my job correctly. I have lots of interests: design, content, web, social media and I feel like everything is connected. I have to work very hard to get approval for tools I need to do my job.
7. I am a writer/editor/Plain Language editor. We need to rebuild our website, and need help. I like to have a dedicated site for government, that’s not from a business, and can trust the information on it.
8. I work in the office of communications, and am the digital manager for the department. I help to manage and govern our digital platforms at the agency, including social media guidance. I run our agency’s web council and led our website redesign. I’ve been in government 16 years and do whatever they need me to do—I just do it.
9. There are two of us who do the same thing: we are the content managers for the site. We are in CIO shop and coordinate across the agency, we create the content types they need. We help train the people and disseminate information. We link to the DGU video archive page from our intranet.
10. I run distance learning trainings for my agency, assist with seasonal training and social media. I do whatever’s needed in the moment.
11. I teach monthly human centered design workshops at my agency. I do communications and human resources work too. I’ve been at my agency for five years.
12. I work in the digital communications office, which is broken into 14 different program offices. We are the gatekeepers: run the Drupal platform, manage digital transitions. We are working on three site migrations right now. I also help with Plain Language and help colleagues structure their work. I’ve been in government for five years. I have a writer/editor background.
13. I’ve been at my agency for two years, and most of my day is working with the 83 entities and programs [in my region] to help them manage websites, communications and social media. We have monthly calls with our regional coordinators and summer is our busiest time. My previous job was as a web manager for five years.
14. I have a background in design and web design and am now a technical manager at my agency. I was first a contractor. I spend more time managing people then doing the work. A large part of agency is made up of lawyers. I’m getting more into user experience. My job is to figure out a way to launch tools that don’t endanger the agency.
15. I’ve been doing design and development and maintenance work for 20 years. I chair the web steering committee that meets quarterly. We are in a consistent cycle of updating sites. Our team wins industry awards for writing.
16. I work on process and improvement, mostly change management and data, at my agency. We focus on data analysis and training, governance design and change management work. There are nine people in my group. I’ve been here for five years. I build products for co-workers—I help people make sense of our internal system to make organizational changes. A lot of people in my agency are eligible for retirement and the average tenure is 25 years. Most of my agency works in field regional offices. The agency mindset is to look to outsiders (like consultants) for advice.
17. I was a contractor, now work in the agency’s central library. I kinda do a lot: Heard the term, McGuyver? It’s a huge agency. All my professional experience has been with the library. I work on the content and management of the library’s website. I’m involved with the agency-wide web committee, 508 and track metrics for three accounts with 20 different reports. We use Google Hangouts to talk to others in agency. I’m thinking of doing a really basic usability study.
18. I started seven years ago as season employee, then got involved with the web portal, now am a contractor  in a regional office. I’m trying to figure out how to make an app. I’m learning on the fly and interested in learning more. I look up to another agency doing similar work. I’m always thinking about the web information.
19. I’m a disability processing specialist. Before that, I was in a field office. I’m interested in learning new skills and seeking out opportunities. A lot of programs push you to become a manager, but I want to stay an analyst.
20. I’ve been at my agency for two years. I’ve spent 15 years in government. I’m on the public affairs team, and work a lot on the Intranet. runs monthly traffic reports. We’re switching CMSs. I began my work with programming and database administration. Currently I work on content and technology. There is a lot of turnover at my current agency because people go back to private sector. I’m also interested in UX and usability testing—recently got certified.


### What are their barriers?

The people we interviewed have many barriers that prevent them from doing their best work for the public. The following are the barriers that were common across everyone we spoke with.

- Not enough budget/resources/time
- Risk averse agency culture
- No seat at the table
- Not enough guidance/information

#### Not enough budget/resources/time

Many people we spoke to voiced an overall concern of not having enough budget, resources or time. Some of the interviewees spoke about functioning at their agencies as teams of one, or just a few, and have to be creative to get the resources they need. Others understand there are limited resources and rely on themselves to get things done.

We were told by some that they would like to spend time looking into larger issues, like various strategies, but that fails to happen when the day-to-day work is so time consuming.

Some had more help, but yet are so overburdened, they just don’t have time to think beyond what needs to get done in the moment. While others may have teams, and understand modern practices, their teams don’t have the necessary skills to do the work, as they have taken on these digital tasks in addition to their core jobs.

#### Resistant to change/risk averse agency culture

Another major barrier we heard was that pockets in agencies have cultures that are resistant to change, or risk averse. We heard that in some offices where the average tenure is high, colleagues may be more resistant to change—at certain agencies, these employees had lived through previous tumultuous times with layoffs and other upheavals, so they learned to keep their heads down and not do anything perceived as risky.

In other departments, the profession held by many employees leads them to be less risk averse by nature, thus making it harder to affect change on a large scale.

While others are constrained by old ways of thinking or practices. In an office where documentation still has to be printed out and left on people’s desks for approval, work slows down if people are out. They are trying to move to a more transparent system, but there’s resistance both in the process and culture.

In some offices, it’s even too burdensome to track down training help on newer collaborative tools, so they stick using when they know, even if it is more cumbersome. And even if they could get trained, their colleagues in other offices are using different software, so it isn’t any easier to collaborate.

#### No seat at the table

This next barrier we heard about, was characterized by a feeling that work in the digital space is a less valued part of an agency’s mission. This sentiment is felt at many levels: from a lack of physical proximity, due to working in an office outside of headquarters, to not being given authority to help make decisions that directly affect their work.

#### Not enough guidance/information to do their jobs

This last barrier we found came from a need to search for more information to do their jobs better, as they found that guidance missing at their own agencies.



### What do they need?
After speaking with all these people, it was apparent they need more support to better serve the public. We see that support falling into these main areas:

- **Tools and Resources**
- **Collaboration**
- **Examples of problems being solved in government**

#### (Tools and Resources) More specific job-related information

Even though many of them are not new to their fields, there is always more to learn, as the digital space keeps growing and changing. Also, after working in these fields for a while, they are also needing outside inspiration.

This information is crucial to modernizing services and much of it is government-specific, to deal with the various rules, regulations and policies.

They’re interested in learning more about:

- Accessibility
- Usability
- Analytics and Reporting
- Agile/lean
- Marketing campaigns
- Strategy
- Data Visualization
- Data Analysis
- AI/VR/AR
- Social media

Many times they are feeling burdened and just need to find information that will give them the confidence to move forward and reassure them they have not missed anything.

Lastly, they need access to the tools and resources that will help them confidently take steps toward working smarter, iterating more frequently and  delivering better, more effective services to the public.

#### (Collaboration) Leverage knowledge and share best practices

Working for federal agencies, many of them crave more opportunities to connect to peers across the government—or even with others in their own agencies—to share what they’ve learned, or learn from others’ experiences. They are interested in participating in spaces where people can more seamlessly communicate and share ideas between teams, with ‘points of contacts’ designated on various topics.

One interviewee even shared his experience, as a field office employee with an interest in learning more about usability practices. Through DigitalGov, and the related communities, he was introduced to someone at his own agency who he didn’t know and connected him to a larger usability effort at headquarters.

They want to know what has worked, how agencies solved problems and what they should aim for in similar efforts. As they are trying to follow modern practices they need help in convincing colleagues and find examples of other agencies’ success to be the most powerful tools. It helps others feel more comfortable adopting modern practices.

Examples of problems being solved in government
They want more information that is specific to government—examples of what agencies are doing; case studies; collections of validated federal-wide news that has an impact on digital in one spot.


#### How do they want it?
They need concise pieces of information to share with others, whom they manage, or work with, and may not have as much knowledge on a particular topic.

This guidance can take the form of: well-organized and maintained lists of tools, resources and checklists.

- They need the information to be easily sharable, printable and easy to distribute.
- Checklists, lists and more lists
- Short videos
- Talk about printing things out and leaving them for others
