Starting in early 2017, the DigitalGov team made a commitment to conducting ongoing user-research as part of its mission to support the people in government responsible for modernizing technology and delivering efficient, effective public services.

Each of our research sprints will start with a statement of what weâ€™re setting out to learn, and finish with a report written to benefit and inform the wider community of thinkers, problem solvers, technologists, and tinkerers in government.
