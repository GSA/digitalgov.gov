### Steps to take
- Use the keyboard to navigate through the page using the `tab` key.
- Make sure you can reach all interactive elements and trigger them with the `spacebar`, `enter` key, or arrow keys.
  - Use semantic HTML elements that are accessible by default (For example: buttons, labeled inputs, etc). If you must use divs for interactions, ensure they are focusable and labeled appropriately.
- Check to see that focus is always visible and appears in logical order.
- Make sure that no content gets focused offscreen or is hidden from view.
- Check to see that the page includes a skip navigation link (if navigation is present before the main content). This will allow users to skip past navigation to reach the page’s main content.
