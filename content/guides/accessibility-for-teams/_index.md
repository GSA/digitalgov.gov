Welcome to the new home for the **Accessibility for Teams** guide. The original site was located at [https://accessibility.digital.gov/](https://accessibility.digital.gov/) and is permanently moved to https://digital.gov/guides/accessibility-for-teams.
{{< /note >}}


* An overview of how each team member can contribute to a product's accessibility
* A framework for thinking about accessibility and inclusive design in your role
* An understanding of the human need behind accessibility practices

We focus on the issues most likely to impact government sites. These guidelines do not provide a comprehensive list of all possible issues. Your team will need additional resources and work to conduct manual audits to conform to the standards of [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) (which aligns with the [W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/)), a law that ensures all web content is accessible to anybody with a disability.

## How to use this guide

- We recommend conducting accessibility testing throughout the design and development processes.
- If you have project-specific questions, ask your agency’s accessibility team.
