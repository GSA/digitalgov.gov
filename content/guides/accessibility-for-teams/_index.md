Everyone who works on government websites has a role to play in making federal resources accessible and inclusive.

**This guide provides:**

- An overview of how each team member can contribute to a product's accessibility.
- A framework for thinking about accessibility and inclusive design in your role.
- An understanding of the human need behind accessibility practices.

We focus on the issues most likely to impact government sites. These guidelines do not provide a comprehensive list of all possible issues. Your team will need additional resources and work to conduct manual audits to conform to the standards of [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), a law that ensures all web content is accessible to anybody with a disability. It aligns with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?versions=2.0&currentsidebar=%23col_overview&levels=a%2Caaa).

Choose the guide that best fits your role:

1. Product management
2. Content design
3. User Experience (UX) design
4. Visual design
5. Front-end development

_These roles are based on the roles we have at the Technology Transformation Services at GSA._
