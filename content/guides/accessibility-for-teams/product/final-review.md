## Request a final review from an accessibility expert.

### Steps to take
- In most cases, you may request a manual accessibility review from the accessibility team at your agency at least two weeks before a public launch. This ensures there’s enough time to conduct the review and make necessary changes. Since you've been manually testing throughout the project, this should be quick.
- Depending on your project’s requirements, you may also choose to hire an outside firm to conduct testing as part of your QA.
