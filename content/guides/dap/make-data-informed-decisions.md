After [adding the Digital Analytics Program (DAP) code](https://digital.gov/guides/dap/get-started-with-dap/#content-start) to collect DAP data, be sure to use it to understand how the public interacts with your agency websites and make data-informed decisions to improve their experience.

## Run custom reports

The DAP team offers several custom reports to deliver website traffic, usage metrics, and user demographics and engagement data.

Watch the video below, Guide to the Digital Analytics Program (DAP): How to find info on user devices, regions, & languages, to learn about the three user-detailed reports for User Device, User Region, and User Language.

{{< note >}} 
DAP is for governmentwide use, and only the DAP team has admin rights to create dashboards and manage users in DAP.

For more administrative control over reporting and user management, the DAP team encourages participating agencies to implement other web analytics tools in addition to DAP.

## Create notifications for custom insights 

You can [create custom insights](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9443595) to define conditions that detect changes in your data that are important to you. When the conditions are triggered, you see the insights on the Insights dashboard, and you can optionally receive email alerts. By default, all users on a property see all triggered custom insights in the Insight dashboard.
