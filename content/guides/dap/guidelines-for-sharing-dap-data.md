## Data that is publicly shareable
Any data appearing on our public dashboard ([analytics.usa.gov](https://analytics.usa.gov/)) can be freely communicated or shared. We also [offer an API](https://open.gsa.gov/api/dap/) for the data behind [analytics.usa.gov](https://analytics.usa.gov/), which is powered by a wealth of data from the Digital Analytics Program (DAP) Google Analytics account.

## Requests for data
Our policy is to refer any data requests for information more granular than what is available on analytics.usa.gov to the agency’s DAP point of contact (POC). It’s the agency’s discretion to provide data related to their sites beyond what is already publicly available. We occasionally receive [Freedom of Information Act](https://www.foia.gov/) (FOIA) requests that we refer to the agency in question.

## Your responsibility
As a user, we ask that you observe similar data confidentiality practices. By logging in and accessing the Digital Analytics Program account, you understand and agree that: 

- Access to the government-wide view of the Digital Analytics Program (DAP) is to assist participating agencies in improving websites across the government.
- Access to this full set of data is restricted to DAP users only.
- Each participating agency controls the distribution and sharing of their own agency-specific data, at the discretion of the agency’s designated DAP POC.
- Agencies are not authorized to communicate or share findings derived from the DAP account about another agency without the other agency’s explicit, written permission (unless those data are already part of the data publicly available on analytics.usa.gov).
