Agencies should use web analytics to better understand user behavior for the purpose of improving public-facing websites and digital services. 

Federal agencies are required to participate in the Digital Analytics Program (DAP). Learn more about the [requirements for delivering a digital-first public experience](https://digital.gov/resources/delivering-digital-first-public-experience/) to understand the policy framework in 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act and OMB Memo M-23-22.

DAP offers a web analytics tool, training, and support to federal agencies. The program is a shared service provided by the [Technology Transformation Services](http://www.gsa.gov/tts) (TTS) at the [U.S. General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov) (GSA).

Participation in DAP does not preclude you from using other web analytics services.

**DAP provides federal agencies with:**

- Free web analytics tools for public-facing federal websites that are comprehensive and easy-to-use
- Scalable infrastructure for measuring a broad range of .gov sites (large and small)
- Training on analytics tools and reporting

  - Ongoing help-desk support around implementation, data, and reporting
