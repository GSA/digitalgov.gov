**The Digital Analytics Program (DAP)** offers a web analytics tool, training, and support to federal agencies. The program is a shared service provided by the [Technology Transformation Services](http://www.gsa.gov/tts) (TTS) at the [U.S. General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov) (GSA).

**We provide federal agencies with:**

- Free web analytics tools for public-facing federal websites that are comprehensive and easy-to-use
- Scalable infrastructure for measuring a broad range of .gov sites (large and small)
- Training on analytics tools and reporting

  - Ongoing help-desk support around implementation, data, and reporting

**DAP is required:**
On September 22, 2023, the [Office of Management and Budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/) (OMB) released a memorandum on [Delivering a Digital-First Public Experience](https://digital.gov/resources/delivering-digital-first-public-experience), which requires executive branch federal agencies to implement the DAP JavaScript code on all public facing federal websites.
