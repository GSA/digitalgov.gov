## RPA Use Case Inventory

Hosted by the Federal RPA Community of Practice (CoP), the [Federal RPA Use Case Inventory](https://staging.d2d.gsa.gov/customer/gsa-ocfo-robotic-process-automation-community-practice) captures RPA use cases from across the federal government. For each automation, the inventory includes descriptive data such as agency name, business function, a high-level description of the use case, and an estimate of the annualized capacity provided.

The Goals of the Use Case Inventory are to: 

-   Increase awareness of current RPA applications across the federal government to increase knowledge sharing and accelerate adoption of innovative technologies.  
-   Make it easier to share  individual agency RPA applications and publish government-wide solutions. 
-   Develop standard performance metrics for RPA deployments that allow accurate statements about government-wide impact of innovative technologies.
