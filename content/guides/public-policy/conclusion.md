Overall, building products and services in government requires understanding how public policy impacts government technology design and implementation. This guide serves as an introductory crash course into how you can engage your teammates in understanding how policy may interact with your team’s design, engineering, product, and security considerations.

## Policy advice for technologists

1. Befriend the policy people: For major statutes and regulations, subject matter policy experts ensure agency offices and groups remain in compliance. We encourage you to get to know those individuals within your organization. 
2. Read the policy yourself: There may be flexibilities in certain laws. In some cases, what people think of as policy could be “the way we’ve always done it.” By reading the policy yourself, you unlock new questions and gain insights on how policies impact your implementation efforts. 
3. Pick your battles: Know whether you’re dealing with a law (very hard to change) or a priority (potential room for interpretation). 
4. Know your boundaries: As technologists, recognize when best to divert questions to your policy colleagues and subject matter experts. 

As public servants, we understand that the government serves the public. In turn, public policy should serve the public interest. This framing provides an opportunity for federal technologists to center the public’s voice when creating and improving federal websites and digital services. 

We hope this guide provides you the confidence to ask questions and engage in policy conversations with your colleagues and stakeholders.
