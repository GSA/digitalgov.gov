However, this report and recommendation from the White House provides insight on how and when agencies may be able to use big data from the Internet of things, the web, mobile, and more, and whether agencies will be required to extend universal Privacy Act Protections.

### METRICS: HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU SUCCESSFULLY DESIGN PARTICIPATION?

- Generate solid baseline data on how much your audience knows, and how well they responded to your message. This will help you determine whether public understanding of your message stayed the same or improved.
- Analyze whether the program becomes integrated with participants or owned by the community.
- Measure:
    - Readership/visits/participation in channels, i.e. programs, sites and blogs.
    - Awareness about the federal agency’s goals, mission, purpose, or resources.
    - Public participation (survey responses, event attendance, other contributions, i.e. time and ideas).
    - Volume of community organizations participating compared to previous programs.
    - Size of community that your partners reach
    - The role of public engagement in the planning/decision-making process.
    - Variation in percentage between current overall participation and previous efforts
    - Online engagement trends (e.g. comments and shares) over the entire length of the event.
    - Engagement across each channel, independently, to determine the level of participation on each.
- For privacy protection, measure:
    - Percentage of your programs, websites and social media sites contain provisions for protecting PII and maintaining Privacy Act compliance.
    - Frequency that community managers monitor comments for PII.
    - Volume of comments community managers delete for PII on a monthly or bi-monthly basis.
    - Frequency of agency record audits to ensure it is not maintaining broader records than necessary.
- For accessibility, start with guidelines in:
    -   [W3C Web Accessibility Metrics](http://www.w3.org/TR/accessibility-metrics-report/ "W3C Web Accessibility Metrics"), a detailed report on useful metrics to assess the accessibility level of websites, including the accessibility level of individual websites, or even large-scale surveys of the accessibility of many websites.
    - [Section 508 Checklist](http://webaim.org/standards/508/checklist "Section 508 Checklist"), including Pass/Fail criteria for each of the Section 508 standards (e.g. a text equivalent for every non-test element, functional electronic forms).
