**The Site Scanning program** automates a wide range of scans of public federal websites and generates data about website health, policy compliance, and best practices.

The program is a shared service provided at no cost for federal agencies and the public to use. At its core is the Federal Website Index, a reference dataset listing all public federal .gov sites by agency/department. Daily scans generate over 1.5 million fields of data about 26,000 federal .gov websites, made publicly available via API and bulk download.

**We scan federal domains for:**

- The presence of agency websites and subdomains
- Digital Analytics Program participation
- Use of the US Web Design System
- Search engine optimization
- Third party services
- IPv6 compliance
- Other best practices

## Access the data directly

All scan data can be downloaded directly as a [CSV or JSON file](data/) or accessed through the [Site Scanning API](https://open.gsa.gov/api/site-scanning-api/).

## Learn more about the program, the scans, and the underlying data

Much deeper program detail can be found in the program's [documentation hub](https://github.com/gsa/site-scanning-documentation). The major sections include:

- [About the Program](https://github.com/gsa/site-scanning-documentation#about)
- [Understanding the Data](https://github.com/gsa/site-scanning-documentation#understanding-the-data)
- [Program Management Documentation](https://github.com/gsa/site-scanning-documentation#program-management)

The creation of the underlying website index is explained in the separate [Federal Website Index repository](https://github.com/GSA/federal-website-index). It includes links to the original datasets, as well as descriptions of how they are assembled and filtered in order to create the list of URLs that are then scanned.
