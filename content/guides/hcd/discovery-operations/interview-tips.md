## Setting up for a good interview

Think of interviews more as guided conversation than formal interviews with listed questions you have to follow. Your research guide should contain keywords or phrases that outline topics you need to cover. This format allows you to work the topics into the conversation fluidly, so that the engagement takes a natural tone.

The night before the interview, check your supplies. A tablet is fine to take notes, but no keyboards; the sounds of keystrokes is distracting to both the interviewer and the interviewee. In terms of dress, business casual is appropriate.

Arrive at the interview site early and gather as a team before entering the interview. Ensure that everyone knows their roles. Review your problem frame statement and elevator pitch, to focus the team and ensure each interview starts from the same informational basis.

Post-interview, gather the on-site team to discuss and jot down interesting points from the interview. Use this time to build on what you learned and develop new things to ask about in the following interviews. After you’re done huddling, send your interviewee a quick email thanking them for their time.

## Interviewing tips

1. Avoid explicitly asking questions about your participants during the interview. Asking direct questions means participants will answer with what they feel sounds right, good, or insightful.
2. Avoid placing the subject with a window behind them; the light coming through means you won’t be able to see their face.
3. If possible, sit where you can see a clock, but place the participant where they cannot see it. If your participant appears to be losing focus or is getting fidgety, it’s okay to ask to check the time or see if they need to take a pause. They might be uncomfortable, because they are about to provide significant information. Another calming tactic is to ask them if it’s okay to continue.
4. Making small talk helps build rapport, so instead of jumping right into the research, open the discussion with neutral matters. Small talk can help create the trust and comfort level that allows for deep, meaningful conversation.
5. Be flexible - every interview is different, so you will need to shift your approach depending on your participant.
6. Mirror their words - don’t lead with what you think they mean. Use their words to ask questions. Sometimes this is as simple as taking a word or phrase they just used and repeating it back to them in a questioning tone of voice.
7. Notetakers should also try to capture non-verbal messages, such as noting the level of passion the participant registers in response to a question, or whether they shift their weight or deflect a topic.
8. Ask for copies of the things they reference. Asking “Could you email that report/document/flyer to me after the interview?” not only gathers information for you but also tells your participant that you are interested in them and their work.
9. Post-interview, team members should offer and welcome feedback about the interview. This is feedback about your craft as both interviewers and listeners. Each team member should practice both giving and receiving constructive, nuanced feedback. What worked well? What could the interviewer, notetaker, or observer improve on?

**Track interview details:** Be sure to record basic information for each interview. Whatever recording method you use, make sure to choose one that organizes the information about interviews in a consistent, detailed way:

- Interviewee name & title
- Date
- Contact information (phone/email/social media)
- Location of interview
- Interviewer
- Notetaker
- Notes
