## Fly on the wall observation

1. Introduce yourself at the beginning of the observation. If you need to, use your elevator pitch to briefly explain to everyone present what your project is, and how you think observing them will help your work. Providing background demystifies your work and allows people to feel at ease.
2. Place yourself somewhere in the room where you have as wide a sight line as possible without being in the direct sightline of any of the participants.
3. Throughout the observation, unobtrusively take notes and photos, if photos are allowed. Remember to turn off the sound on your camera so you don’t have a distracting shutter noise when you take photos.
4. Note where you have questions about the process, but save them until after you are done with the observation. Your goal is to understand the entire flow of the system; interrupting the participant with questions will create a flow that does not represent the true participant experience.
5. If the participant continuously engages you as they move through the system, be prepared to pivot into a more active role, even into one of participatory observation.


## Participatory observation

1. Introduce yourself at the beginning of the observation. If you need to, use your elevator pitch to briefly explain to everyone present what your project is and how you think observing them will help your work. Providing background demystifies your work and allows people to feel at ease.
2. Place yourself wherever the participant directs you and follow their lead.
3. As you participate, be aware of how your level of embarrassment or anxiety relates to doing something new, versus how the system in which you’re participating creates discomfort for participants.
4. Ask questions if you’re confused about the process. Note these points if you can, as they indicate points at which either the participant has simply gotten used to a bad system, or points at which new users of the system might encounter difficulties.

**Track observation details:** Observation notes can include photos, diagrams, and expressive language that describes the sensorial aspects of the system. Record your notes in whatever medium is most convenient, but keep it all neatly together. Being able to easily reference your notes will be crucial during the synthesis phase.
