## Problem framing

**Project Lead**

Manage the overall project, as well as early-stage conceptualization and articulation of the problem frame.

**Leadership**

If the project was generated from leadership, leaders should:

- Be deeply involved in the project-framing process.
- Agree to actively lend their sponsorship and support to the project.
- Work to ensure consensus and knowledge amongst their peers, as well as any partner organization(s).

(Note, leaders are generally not involved with grassroots projects at this stage.)


## Leadership buy-in

**Project Lead**

Regular, ongoing communication with leadership and key stakeholders, including:

- Explain the frame and the logic behind that frame.
- Demonstrate the value of the project.
- Gain sponsorship and ongoing support for the project.

**Current/Potential Team Members**

- Help the research lead sell the project to leadership.

- Help define the shape of the team, including determining whether or not the project needs to have a local contact.

    - If so, identify the type of local contact needed, and begin recruiting.

**Team Members**

  - Sort themselves into preferred project roles, and communicate those preferences to the research lead.
  - Maintain flexibility by recognizing they may have responsibilities outside of their preferred role, and that their role may change as the project progresses. For example, one team member might start as the recruiter and then move into the logistics coordinator role.

**Local Contact**

- Gain permission from local leadership to participate in the project.
