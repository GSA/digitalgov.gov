## Project Lead

Must be HCD-trained and have experience leading HCD projects. For large-scale projects with multiple research teams, this person should have management training as well. Responsibilities include:

- Liaise and communicate with leadership and stakeholders, and relay communications back to the team.
- Lead interviews and/or observations.
- Guide post-interview downloading sessions, daily and weekly synthesis work.
- Lead team through exercises to find insights and opportunities, and communicate results to leadership.
- Ensure that all benchmarking, research, interview notes and photographs, deliverables, and recommendations are organized in an approved location.

**Notes**: On a large project, there may be more than one lead due to specialty knowledge or geographic location. In these cases, the leads are responsible for organizing themselves into a functional unit that can communicate with each other fluidly, consistently communicate to the team and stakeholders, and flex around changes in the project.


## Researcher

Must be HCD trained, or an HCD-trained team member must directly oversee their work. Responsibilities include:

- Select research strategies.
- Lead interviews and/or observations.

**Note-taking includes:**

- Observing the area & interview subject and documenting interesting things.
- Transcribing notes into digital format.
- Filing notes, photos, and other documentation in the project folder.


## Recruiter
