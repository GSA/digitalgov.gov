## Setting up for a good observation

Observations present an opportunity for first-hand understanding of your participants’ experience. Observations, like interviews, have many styles, but a good place to start is to choose one of two broad approaches: fly-on-the-wall or participatory observation.

Fly-on-the-wall observations mean that the researcher stays silent while the participant accomplishes the task(s) that are pertinent to your project. Take notes and, if possible, pictures, while they accomplish their work, so that you can understand the ins and outs of the system(s) in which they interact.

Participatory observation means getting hands-on experience with system(s). This can mean anything from playing a role in the interaction with your participant, to actually learning all or part of the system from the participant so that you can experience it yourself.

In both of these methods, the data you collect will be multi-sensorial. It’s important to note what you see and hear, of course, but also pay attention to what you might touch, or how you might have to move, what smells or distractions there might be. When writing your notes, strive to use expressive language so that you can remember these different sensorial aspects of the observation.
