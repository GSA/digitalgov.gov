# Welcome!

The Human-Centered Design (HCD) Guides are intended to enhance the understanding and practice of human-centered design throughout the federal government. In this guide series, we will explore the four phases of HCD work: **discovery, design, delivery,** and **measurement**.

You can think of the HCD Guides like a travel series through design. In the same way you can collect travel guides to Kyoto and Tokyo and Nagasaki instead of a single, lengthy all-Japan travel guide, our HCD Guide series provides two volumes for each phase of the HCD process: a concept guide, focusing on why the phase works the way it does, and an operations guide with checklists and frameworks to help with the how of the phase.
