## Pair up

Conduct your research in pairs. Identify the person who will ask questions and the person who will take notes. The interviewer should focus on the interviewee; the notetaker is there to support and document. Introduce yourselves, explain the consent form, and ask the participant to sign it. The notetaker can secure the signed form.

## Equipment

The equipment for this kind of research is simple and low-tech. Don’t bring your laptop into an interview unless absolutely necessary. And do not use it to take notes. Instead, notes should be hand-written. If you have received consent to capture audio, use a recording device, such as a smartphone. Reserve a quiet, private room or wherever your participant feels comfortable. This may be in the participant’s home, at office, or in a public place of the participant’s choosing. No matter where the interview takes place, try to create a safe, comfortable, and quiet space where your participant can speak honestly about the subject.

## Prepare for the interview

Here are some quick tips for the interview:

- Whenever possible, meet with participants at their home, work, or a place where they feel most themselves, such as their local library or coffee shop.
- Pack bottled water for you, your participant, and your teammate(s).
- Bring multiple copies of the Informed Consent Form.
- Review your participant information one more time.
- Take a moment for yourself, whether in the hallway or interview space, to clear your mind and focus on the interview ahead, before you begin.
- Arrive early to the interview site.


## Lead the interview

### Be fluid

Interviews should be planned and questions outlined (not scripted). During the interview itself, consider your interview script as a compass that guides you. Feel free to go “off script” or change questions if you feel that will benefit the conversation and research.


### Ask open-ended questions

Allow participants to answer in their own unique way by asking them easy to follow, open-ended (as opposed to yes-or-no) questions.


### Use the ‘5 Whys’

This strategy helps to clarify the conversation when your interviewee speaks in generalities or uses ambiguous words like “fine”. The 5 Whys strategy is to simply ask your interviewee “Why do you say that?” or “What does “fine” mean to you?”. Ask “why” 5 times in a row, building off each of their answers.

Additional ways to get at the 5 Whys include:

- What experiences motivated you to take part in this project?
- How do you feel about that? (Listen for feelings, versus thoughts)
- What do you think about that?
- Tell me about that.
- That’s an interesting thought; can you help me understand what you mean by that?
- Why do you think that?


### Know when to pivot

Stay mindful of the situation and purpose. Use what your participant says as direction on where to go in the interview. Ask yourself: Is this part of the conversation informing the challenge or “How Might We” question? Can it inform the question if I continue this line of conversation, or should I redirect my approach? If a participant embarks on an interesting tangent, use your best judgment to surface insights that might inform your research.


### Close the interview at the right time

How long is enough? Tough question. The answer is that you’ll get a better sense of this with practice. You need enough time to build rapport, allow the participant to open up, and share their story.

Good interviews can be draining for the participant and for the interview team. It’s important to respect people’s time and wind down the interview in a timely manner. Don’t go over the planned time frame. If an interviewee seems tapped out before the scheduled end, gently close out early. Always thank the person for their time. Provide follow up information as necessary, such as contact details.


## Gather information

Here are some quick tips on how to gather information during the interview.

- With pen and notepad in hand, jot down interesting words, phrases, or metaphors. (Interviewer)
- Position yourself at an angle to the participant, so you’re not facing them straight on. (Interviewer)
- Speak slowly so as to give yourself time to think. This also helps put your participant at ease. (Interviewer)
- If you hear an interesting word used, ask about it, even if you’re not sure where it will lead you. (Interviewer)
- Be aware of your interviewee’s tone and body language. Read the signs and pivot if you notice discomfort.
- Listen intently, and transcribe the interviewee’s answers verbatim (as possible). Do not paraphrase. Listen for strong or interesting quotes. Mark them for later. (Notetaker)
