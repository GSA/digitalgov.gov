Synthesis happens when the research team comes together, brings all the interviews and qualitative research they’ve gathered to the table, and looks for patterns and themes. You may do synthesis in your research pairs, or you may bring your synthesized research to a larger group for further, cross-group synthesis.

Think of synthesis as a group effort to take all the interviews, findings, and qualitative research data you’ve collected, and filter it through the Project Brief lens, to identify the data most relevant to your research topic. Reflect on the relevant data and work to identify common patterns or trends. 


## Environment and materials

Find a quiet space where you and your team can talk and interact over the course of a half-day or day. Make sure this space has tables or desks, adequate lighting, and, ideally, clear window and wall spaces.

Have on hand the following supplies: pens, paper, and tape. Sticky notes, markers, and presentation-style paper tablets or rolls are also helpful. The visual aids you make with these materials will help you sort, arrange, and rearrange your research findings to find patterns and trends.
