The [Connected Government Act](https://digital.gov/resources/connected-government-act/), which was signed into law in January 2018, requires new, and redesigned, agency websites to be mobile-friendly. The Connected Government Act also codified the [OMB memo M-17-06, Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites and Digital Services (PDF, 1.2 MB, 18 pages, November 2016)](https://digital.gov/resources/omb-m-17-06) which required agencies to create mobile-friendly websites.

{{< note >}} As of September 22, 2023, OMB Memorandum [M-23-22](https://digital.gov/resources/delivering-digital-first-public-experience/) rescinds M-17-06. {{< /note >}}

In order to help you comply, we decided it’s time to start reviewing good mobile web development practices. Over the next couple of months, we will share eight principles of mobile-friendliness (one each week)&mdash;and how adhering to these principles can greatly improve your site.

## The Principles

In 2017, the [MobileGov Community of Practice](https://digital.gov/communities/mobile/) tested the top federal websites most visited on mobile devices (smartphones and tablets). The results of the automated tests, [A Guide to To Creating Mobile-Friendly Web Sites](https://digital.gov/resources/guide-create-mobile-friendly-websites/), showed us that a few common practices greatly affect the usability of a site on a mobile device.

Building on 2019 results, we are back at it again&mdash;but this time we examined the automated testing tools themselves. During this review, we found there are eight principles of mobile-friendliness. And if you follow them, they will make your site more usable and user-friendly.

<!-- As a reminder, **check back each week for another principle** that we distilled from Google's [Mobile Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly) tool, [DigitalDashboard.gov](https://www.digitaldashboard.gov/), and the [Information Technology & Innovation Foundation (ITIF) Benchmarking Report](https://itif.org/publications/2017/03/08/benchmarking-us-government-websites). We will provide a description of the issue, a method to detect the issue, and solutions to eliminate or prevent the issue from appearing on your site to help make it more mobile-friendly. -->

Let’s get started!
