For six months, from September 22, 2017 to March 22, 2018, we tested the 26 U.S. federal government websites most visited by mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) using seven mobile-friendly automated test tools. The results indicated that these were the common practices that make these sites not as mobile-friendly as a user might expect or want in a mobile experience. Most of these areas do not directly relate to usability issues, but instead, concern how the site is built (which can lead to poor performance). For more information on how we conducted the tests, see the Methodology section in the guide’s navigation menu.

The information here outlines the top four practices we found across these sites. The most common issue found on these sites involves the use of JavaScript. JavaScript is used on many desktop and mobile applications because it extends the functionality of web pages, is a relatively easy language to learn and use, and it executes relatively quickly on the client side. However, if JavaScript is not placed and executed from an optimal place in the code, not minimized, nor used inline, it may negatively affect the application performance on mobile devices that traditionally have minimal resources.
