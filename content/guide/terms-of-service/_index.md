Digital media is key to helping federal agencies engage with their customers and accomplish their mission. However, the standard Terms of Service (or Terms of Use) for most free digital products and services are incompatible with federal law, regulation, or practice.

To meet this need, a coalition of federal agencies, led by GSA, works with a broad range of providers of no-cost social and digital media products to develop amended, federally compatible TOS agreements. GSA leads this effort to reduce the need for dozens of agencies to negotiate TOS agreements and to streamline negotiations with vendors through a single [point of contact]({{< ref "agency-points-of-contact-for-federal-compatible-terms-of-service-agreements.md" >}}).

While these TOS amendments resolve the major legal issues of the sign-up process, agencies must still comply with laws and regulations on security, privacy, accessibility, records retention, ethical use, and other specific agency policies and requirements when using the tools.

## How Does Mobile Fit?

Agencies who develop native applications for specific devices need to sign Terms of Service Agreements with the mobile product companies. These Terms of Service have two parts: a developer agreement and a distribution agreement. The developer agreement allows the agency to access that platform’s software and tools to develop applications. Once the application is completed, the distribution agreement allows agencies to offer their completed application to customers for free.

Federal friendly Terms of Service for distribution agreements have been negotiated with Amazon Appstore and BlackBerry App World. Please contact your agency [TOS point of contact]({{< ref "agency-points-of-contact-for-federal-compatible-terms-of-service-agreements.md" >}} "Agency Points of Contact for Federal Compatible Terms of Service Agreements") or <socialmediaapps@gsa.gov> with questions about Apple and Google Play.

## For Federal Agency Points of Contact

If you’re an agency point of contact, the [OMB Memorandum M–13–10](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2013/m-13-10.pdf) (PDF, 1.2 MB, 17 pages, April 2013) outlines the following steps that agencies should follow:

  1. Conduct an inventory of social media applications currently in use at your agency.
  2. Publish your social media inventory with corresponding TOS at &#8220;agency.gov/socialmediaTOS&#8221;.
  3. If your agency identifies a TOS that includes an open-ended indemnification clause, work with your legal team to renegotiate the TOS.
  4. Provide an update to [DigitalGov](mailto:digitalgov@gsa.gov) regarding any TOS your agency is negotiating. Coordinating with GSA ensures we are not duplicating efforts.

## For State and Local Governments

The National Association of State Chief Information Officers (NASCIO) and the National Association of Attorneys General have collaborated in Terms of Service negotiations with tool and service providers on behalf of state governments.

They negotiated revised terms with Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter:

  * Facebook made changes to their [standard terms that apply to state and local governments](http://www.facebook.com/terms_pages_gov.php).
  * Twitter [incorporated revisions in Section 12B](http://twitter.com/tos) of their most recent general TOS update.
  * The [YouTube terms are available to state government agencies that](http://www.nascio.org/newsroom/pressRelease.cfm?id=119) request them through their State CIOs.

Negotiations with other providers are ongoing.

## For Tool and Service Providers

GSA welcomes expressions of interest from providers who want to offer, for the federal government&#8217;s consideration, products that are free of charge. GSA developed a [model TOS template](https://s3.amazonaws.com/digitalgov/_legacy-img/2014/01/model-amendment-to-tos-for-g.doc) (MS Word, 55 KB, 5 pages, October 2011) listing the points, issues, and concerns that typically arise in standard Terms of Service and are problematic for federal agencies. This model agreement suggests replacements that would be acceptable to most federal agencies.

If you are such a provider, see the guidance about how to express interest in offering an amended TOS or updating a current one.

Tool and service providers interested in engaging in Terms of Service discussions with NASCIO, should [review its open letter to providers](http://www.nascio.org/advocacy/current/NASCIO-SM-Legal-WG-Open-Letter-to-Providers-Final.pdf) for background and contact information.
