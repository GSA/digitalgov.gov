Whether you are looking for a career change or a new neighborhood to call home, life decisions affect each of us every day.

With roughly half of Americans now owning smartphones, everyone should be able to access the wealth of statistics the Census Bureau collects to make informed decisions on the go, whether at home or on the road.

What good are data if nobody but the experts can easily access them? The Census Bureau uses 21st century technology to meet its centuries-old mission, making the statistics that define our growing, changing nation more accessible to the public than ever before.

The Census Bureau’s new mobile app, _dwellr_, provides those on the go with immediate, personalized access to the latest demographic, socio-economic and housing statistics from the American Community Survey for neighborhoods across the nation.

> Using the level of importance you place on a location’s characteristics, **the app generates a list of top 25 towns or cities most suitable for you.** Once you have used the app, it saves your selections on your phone so you can see how they match up against each new place you visit.

With more than 30 million Americans moving last year, _dwellr_ allows for quick and easy access to information to help make the decision, including the ages of residents, how many families have children, median income and housing costs. _Dwellr_ allows Apple and Android smartphone users to explore a range of questions making it a powerful tool for:

  * Homebuyers
  * Members of the military being deployed domestically
  * Real estate agents, and
  * New businesses and teachers helping students learn about their communities.

The statistics in _dwellr_ are only the beginning of a powerful story you can tell with Census Bureau data. Imagine if an app matched your preferences with restaurant reviews, places with museums or most visited parks. With the Census Bureau’s application programming interface, developers can take the same statistics found in _dwellr_ and apply them to any app they can imagine.

We are eager to see new applications of these American Community Survey statistics that help people learn more about their communities using the same information businesses use to plan investments and services. These statistics, along with the Census Bureau’s other economic information, provide timely, critical information on the health of the U.S. economy.

The app is just the latest product from the Census Bureau’s digital transformation and provides statistics to more Americans in a new and user-friendly way. It follows the successful release of our hugely popular [America’s Economy mobile app](http://www.census.gov/mobile/economy/), which now has more than 100,000 downloads.

Coming soon, you will see an upgraded census.gov website with enhanced search and navigation features that are based on several years of customer feedback. We continue to open up more of our data to developers as part of our API, including 30 years of decennial statistics, in addition to the American Community Survey statistics that power _dwellr_.

As we continue to align ourselves with the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government-strategy.pdf" target="_blank">Digital Government Strategy</a>, our free mobile apps are just one way we are making our statistics available anytime, anywhere, and on nearly any device.

Download _dwellr_ from the [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.gov.census.phone.dwellr) or [Apple store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dwellr/id744395884?mt=8) today and begin learning more about where you are and where you could go in the future.
