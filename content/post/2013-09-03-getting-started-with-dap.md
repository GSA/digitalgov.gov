The <a href="https://www.WHATEVER/services/dap/" target="_blank">Digital Analytics Program (DAP)</a> is delighted to announce the launch of a DAP user group and new training program. These initiatives will support DAP users in getting the most from their implementation.

The kick-off for this user group will be on Thursday, September 12, 2013, when we will host a webinar to welcome  users and discuss how a user group can provide the most benefit. Meeting invitations with login instructions will be sent to directly to these users two weeks before the meeting.

The User Group will meet monthly to discuss topics of interest including:

>   * Creating Google Analytics Dashboards and Reporting from DAP
>   * Working with Google Analytics Data Sampling Limits
>   * Updates on DAP Code Releases

Additionally, the DAP training program will provide monthly training blog posts published. Training topics will include discussions on advanced segments, custom reports and topics identified in the DAP User Group.

The DAP User Group and the training posts are meant to educate and empower the DAP users to get the most out of the DAP Google Analytics data, so submit your DAP discussion topics and suggestions via [email](mailto:dap@support.WHATEVER) today.
