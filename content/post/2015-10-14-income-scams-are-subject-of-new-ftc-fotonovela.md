The FTC’s second Spanish-language fotonovela is about scams that promise you can make money selling high-end products or brand-name merchandise. If the pitch sounds familiar, that’s because the story is based on facts from a recent [Federal Trade Commission] [FTC lawsuit](http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/work-home-opportunity-thats-not-so-golden) against a company that targeted Spanish speakers nationwide.

Income Scams tells the story of Fatima, a consumer who is looking for a way to earn some extra money. She gets a phone call:

> “I have a great opportunity for you to make money with our company. We’re very well known in your area. You can buy brand name products like purses and perfumes from us at wholesale prices. Then you sell them to your friends and family and make a profit.”

The caller tells her she can pay by money order when the merchandise is delivered.
