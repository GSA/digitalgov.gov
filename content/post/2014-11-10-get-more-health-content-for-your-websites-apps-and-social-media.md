Several federal agencies and offices have worked together to create a free and easy way for public health partners to incorporate our Web content, images, video, data, and infographics into other sites, apps, and social media. Through digital media syndication, the science-based resources of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) can be combined with your ongoing activities at the state and local levels, and can help coordinate health messaging for maximum impact and reach.

This service is offered under the umbrella project called Content Services (CS)—a cumulative effort pulled together across HHS to disseminate information to other federal agencies, state and local health departments, and the public.

 **In your local websites, apps, and social media profiles:**

## Q: Sounds Great! How Do I Get Started?

### A: Three Easy Steps to More Health Content

These resources are offered through federal digital media syndication sites that are easy to use, regardless of your technical expertise or size of your team. When you syndicate content, automatic updates mean minimal maintenance on your part, and technical assistance and support mean help is always available.

  1. **Register** at these sites and get anytime access to high-quality content, plus alerts when new content is added.
  2. **Discover** content by browsing digital products from across government agencies that can be integrated into your own sites and applications.
  3. **Send** feedback to tell us how the system can be improved, new types of content you want to see included, or contact us with questions.

## Still not convinced about the benefits?

Think about it, Content Syndication (CS) allows:

  * Content Re-use 
      * Leverage inter-agency content to reduce overhead and streamline content channels
  * Audience Retention 
      * Retain and grow audiences based on content
  * 24/7 Content 
      * Deliver content to your audience where, when, and how they want to consume it

## Why is this being done?

The goal of the effort is to meet the standards of the Digital Strategy.

  * Provide access to digital government information and services anywhere, anytime, on any device
  * Procure and manage devices, applications, and data in smart, secure and affordable ways
  * Unlock the power of government data to spur innovation

Additionally, CS works to further the agenda of the Open Government Initiative. The API and available services offer transparency and encourage participation and collaboration.

The workgroup convened based on an effort from CDC to syndicate their Web content during the H1N1 outbreak. Now, the group is a a collaborative effort from several HHS organizations and is growing. It consists of team members from CDC, HHS, NIH, FDA. The group is quickly growing with interest from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), General Services Administration (GSA), Census and Social Security.
