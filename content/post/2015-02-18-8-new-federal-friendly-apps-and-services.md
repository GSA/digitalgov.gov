Tackling technology tasks just got easier.

Recently, federal agencies negotiated eight new Terms of Service (TOS) Agreements for free apps and services. DigitalGov has an extensive [list of federal-friendly TOS agreements](https://www.WHATEVER/resources/negotiated-terms-of-service-agreements/) for free products, and the list is updated as new TOS agreements are created.

## Cyfe

[Cyfe](http://www.cyfe.com/), a business dashboard app, helps users monitor diverse data streams in one location. It displays information related to social media, analytics, marketing, sales, support, and infrastructure tools. The app stores data securely, allowing for the sharing of editable or read only dashboards. This TOS agreement was negotiated by the **General Services Administration (GSA)**.

## Google Wallet

[Google Wallet](https://www.google.com/wallet/) is a mobile payment system. It works with credit, debit, gift, and loyalty cards. Money can be received or sent to anyone in the U.S. with a Gmail address. Users can pay in stores or online and can also use select ATMs. This TOS agreement was negotiated by the **Department of Energy**.

## IFTTT

[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/), or “If This Then That,” is a web-based service centered on the use of conditional statements, or “recipes.” Using a set of criteria from a pool of web apps, users create recipes: when a specific action occurs on one app, that app will trigger another app and cause it to perform a function. Basically, if this happens, then that action will occur. This TOS agreement was negotiated by **GSA**.

A recent article on DigitalGov explains [how agencies can use IFTTT](https://www.WHATEVER/2015/02/12/ifttt-combines-social-media-mobile-and-internet-of-things-for-government/) in a variety of ways and encourages agencies to submit their own ideas or examples.

## Mandrill

[Mandrill](https://mandrill.com/) is an email infrastructure service with a mobile app that allows users to monitor delivery and troubleshoot globally. It offers various template options, custom tagging, and tracking and reports. Users can send automated one-to-one email and newsletters. This TOS agreement was negotiated by **GSA**.

## POP

The Prototyping on Paper app, [POP](https://popapp.in/), combines the paper and digital worlds with one tool. By uploading photo sketches into the app, users can share ideas with colleagues, create prototypes, and conduct user testing. It also has a web interface that supports Dropbox and Adobe Creative Cloud, for making high fidelity prototypes. This TOS agreement was negotiated by the **Federal Reserve Board**.

## Slack

The team communication platform, [Slack](https://slack.com/), is a collaborative working area. The tool has an array of features &#8211; one-on-one messaging, private groups, persistent chat rooms, direct messaging &#8211; and is available as both an app and web platform. Users are able to search all of the content in a team’s Slack through one search box. This TOS agreement was negotiated by the **Department of State**.

## StackExchange

[StackExchange](http://stackexchange.com/) is a network of question and answer websites. Created for the programming community, it covers a variety of topics, including: [Open Data](http://opendata.stackexchange.com/), [User Experience](http://ux.stackexchange.com/), and [Programming](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/). The sites are self-moderated, subjecting users to a reputation award process. This TOS agreement was negotiated by **GSA**.

DigitalGov’s [article on the Open Data Stack Exchange](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/09/10/stacking-up-the-benefits-of-openness/) highlighted how agencies and the public can interact on the platform.

## Trello

[Trello](https://trello.com/) is a web-based project management application. Projects are displayed as boards, which subsequently contain task lists and corresponding task cards. Cards can be part of multiple lists, representing movement of an idea from thought to tangible creation. This TOS agreement was negotiated by **GSA**.
