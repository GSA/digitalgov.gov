Four years ago, BusinessUSA launched with a mission to revolutionize the way government provides services to small businesses and exporters. Using technology to erase bureaucratic boundaries, BusinessUSA streamlined the way businesses find and get what they need from government. This “no wrong door” approach combined resources from over 800 websites and created a single point of entry for businesses looking to grow and expand.

At [USAGov](http://usa.gov/explore), we’ve been fans and supporters of BusinessUSA since the beginning. And although we serve different audiences, our two programs have shared the same fundamental vision &#8211; that government should use technology to make it easier for people to find the federal resources they need.

We’re now thrilled to announce that USAGov will be integrating the two websites in order to provide a single, comprehensive collection of tools and resources—delivered in one central website. In the coming months, we’ll be working to build the best of Business.USA.gov into the USAGov platform. Once complete, this cutting-edge platform will better serve the American public and the nation’s businesses.

We look forward to sharing more details with you this summer. As we work through this exciting merger, the BusinessUSA email newsletter will take a short summer break while we integrate the email systems.  In the meantime, you can stay in the loop with business news on the [BusinessUSA Twitter](https://twitter.com/BizUSA/) account, and get updates on the website integration project and all things USAGov by [signing up to our blog](http://connect.usa.gov/blog-email-sign-up-page).
