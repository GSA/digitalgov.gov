A long time ago in a federal agency building far, far away on F Street… the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">Great Federal Mobile Product Hunt</span>](https://www.WHATEVER/2015/05/21/start-sleuthing-with-the-great-federal-mobile-product-hunt/) <span style="font-weight: 400">launched at the <a href="https://summit.WHATEVER/">DigitalGov Citizen Services Summit</a> in Washington, DC. The campaign goal has not waivered from the initial launch because the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">USA.gov Mobile Apps Directory</span>](https://www.usa.gov/mobile-apps) <span style="font-weight: 400">remains incomplete. The Directory is the authoritative source for federal mobile Web products, and federal agencies that do </span><span style="font-weight: 400">not</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">have their apps registered here are losing out on valuable promotional opportunities on </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">USA.gov</span>](https://www.usa.gov/mobile-apps) <span style="font-weight: 400">and </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">DigitalGov</span>](https://www.WHATEVER/tag/thursday-mobile-products/)<span style="font-weight: 400">. The hunt for the apps yet to be added to the Directory, henceforth labeled as #lostapps, is alive and well with the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)</span>](http://www.noaa.gov/) <span style="font-weight: 400">taking the lead at Day 100.  </p> 

<p>
  The leadership board was neck and neck at <a href="https://www.WHATEVER/2015/07/09/day-50-the-great-federal-mobile-product-hunt/">Day 50</a>, but NOAA decided to join the #lostapps hunt and drop the mic.  NOAA added 30 mobile products to the Directory that included </span><a href="http://www.education.noaa.gov/mobile/index.php"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ka’ena Point Guide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, a clearinghouse for education resources for visitors, recreational enthusiasts, students and local residents. (</span><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kaena-point/id663110768?mt=8"><span style="font-weight: 400">Available on iTunes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">)</p>
