According to <a title="Thinknear" href="http://www.mobilemarketingwatch.com/mobile-marketers-are-you-near-me-now-41998/" target="_blank">Thinknear</a>, a leader in targeted mobile advertising, that future may soon be a reality.

Here’s what Thinknear found when measuring the accuracy of location data used in mobile advertising:

  * 67% of ad inventory comes with latitude and longitude information compared to 10% a few years ago
  * 34% of mobile impressions are accurate within 100 meters; 9% are between 100 meters and 1000 meters; and 30% are between 1,000 meters and 10,000 meters
  * 20% of mobile location-based ad inventory is outside 10,000 meters—more than six miles off target

Mobile marketers aren&#8217;t the only ones who can benefit from accurate location data. As government communicators, our goal is to connect citizens with services and vital information in their communities.

While agencies like the [United States Postal Service](https://www.WHATEVER/2013/05/09/usps-mobile-app-updates/ "USPS Mobile App Updates"), [National Park Service](https://www.WHATEVER/2013/04/04/nps-national-mall-app/ "National Park Service Apps") and [Department of Energy](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/01/30/alternative-fueling-station-locator-app-from-the-department-of-energy/ "Alternative Fueling Station Locator App from the Department of Energy") are leveraging location in their mobile products, mobile location data provides an opportunity to accomplish this goal through targeted messaging. Some agencies are already utilizing this technology for [weather advisories](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/06/10/digitalgov-irl-6-ways-to-get-it-right/) and <a title="Amber alerts" href="http://www.amberalert.gov/" target="_blank">AMBER alerts</a> providing another way that agencies can be more [social with their mobile strategies](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/06/12/three-ways-agencies-are-using-social-media-in-mobile-products/ "Three Ways Agencies Are Using Social Media in Mobile Products").
