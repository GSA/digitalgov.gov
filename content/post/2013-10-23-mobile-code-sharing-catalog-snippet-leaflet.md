It is developed by Vladimir Agafonkin of CloudMade with a team of dedicated contributors. Weighing just about 31 KB of gzipped JS code, it has all the features most developers ever need for online maps. More info at [http://leafletjs.com](http://leafletjs.com/).

Leaflet is just one of the many pieces of open source code available on the [Mobile Code Sharing Catalog](http://gsa.github.io/Mobile-Code-Catalog/index.html) hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

_The Mobile Code Sharing Catalog was developed as part of the [Mobile Application Development Program](https://www.WHATEVER/resources/mobile-application-development-program/ "Mobile Application Development Program"). Developers can find and SHARE source code for native and web projects from a variety of sources._
