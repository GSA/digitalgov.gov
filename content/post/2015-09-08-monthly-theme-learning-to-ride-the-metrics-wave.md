We are awash in [data](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/04/01/digital-analytics-program-dap-oceans-of-data/). Data in our personal lives gives us information on everything from our nightly sleeping patterns to how many of our friends shared our latest quip on social media.

All of this data can help us make smart decisions that will ultimately provide our customers with a better experience—but only if we know what our end goals are and what metrics we need to measure to get there. Only then will we not be overwhelmed by the tidal wave of data and will surf that wave to the shores of our customers.
