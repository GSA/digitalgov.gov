DGU strives to provide training throughout the year that is useful and relevant to you. One of the most resounding comments from digital managers last year was people wanted to be able to attend all of our classes virtually. With very few exceptions, we made sure that there was a virtual component in every training, so that all our attendees, no matter where they were located, can attend and learn.

#### **Analytics and new communications technologies, anyone?** {#4299.graf.graf--h4.graf-after--p}

Some of our most popular training topics throughout the year focused on using programs such as analytics trainings offered through the [Digital Analytics Program](https://www.WHATEVER/services/dap/) and trainings on how to use the [DigitalGov Search](https://www.WHATEVER/services/search/) program. Other popular events were from the various [DigitalGov Communities](https://www.WHATEVER/communities/) like the [MobileGov Community of Practice](https://www.WHATEVER/communities/mobile/), [Challenge and Prizes Community of Practice](https://www.WHATEVER/communities/challenges-prizes-community/), and the [Government Customer Experience Community of Practice](https://www.WHATEVER/communities/customer-experience-community/) where best practices, case studies, and innovations were shared.

We heard that you are interested in the latest tools and trends and how federal agencies are using those products, which is why “[Snaps and Stripes: Sharing Public Service Stories with SnapChat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G82jBHxE4Tk)” was a popular webinar this year. Also, you wanted to know how tools like social listening to address and better understand your audience and their needs so many of you attended the “[Listening Before We Speak: Understanding Our Audience in Times of Disaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWhRLCxTYxk)” webinar.

One of the highest attended (and highest rated) events came from longtime community member, [Sam Bronson](https://www.WHATEVER/author/sam-bronson/) of HHS, who shared the need for actionable analytics and the important steps agencies can take in setting up their own analytics program in his webinar, “[The Golden Partnership: How to Improve Website Findability with Actionable Analytics and Content Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pjc-dEPBExE).” In fact, we heard from one attendee following the event who [has written about how it inspired her to take a different approach for a website project](https://medium.com/@DigitalGov/well-begun-is-half-done-lets-tidy-up-the-website-c19134c53af). We’d like to host more events driven by [community members in the digital government space](https://www.WHATEVER/communities/) so we look forward to more examples of great work being done in 2017. We’ll also continue to make sure that all of our trainings have an online component that let’s you attend from anywhere.
