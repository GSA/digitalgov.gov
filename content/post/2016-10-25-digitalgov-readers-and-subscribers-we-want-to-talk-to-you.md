Over the course of the next few weeks, a small team from 18F and Office of Products and Programs are working on reimagining a future DigitalGov and DigitalGov University.

We are looking to talk to a few readers of DigitalGov.gov. If you are interested, [email Carolyn Dew](mailto:carolyn.dew@gsa.gov?subject= DigitalGov%20DGU%20Interview) and let us know if you are interested and when you are most available.

Interviews usually last an hour and happen over phone or a Google Hangout.
