The U.S. government has launched more than 45 [challenge and prize competitions](https://challenge.gov/ "Challenge.gov list of federal prize competitions") so far in Fiscal Year 2014. What trends are we seeing? Well, the trend is&#8230;diversity. That might sound like an oxymoron, but federal agencies are really putting themselves out there, asking the crowd to help tackle a wide array of problems.

Until August 3rd, **NASA** is seeking ways to [improve email for astronauts on the International Space Station](http://www.topcoder.com/dtn/astronaut-email/ "Better astronaut email challenge"). <span style="color: #444444;">The <strong>Small Business Administration</strong> is looking for <a title="SBA Accelerator Challenge" href="https://gaf2014.wufoo.com/forms/sba-growth-accelerator-fund-application/">accelerators and other entrepreneurial ecosystem models</a> to compete for monetary prizes of $50,000 each to fund operating budgets. </span>Citizens can submit their ideas through TopCoder.com, or by filling out a simple Web form.

The diversity trend continues, with the many platforms and websites federal agencies are using to power challenge and prize competitions. **HHS**&#8216;s Office of the National Health Coordinator is using GSA&#8217;s [sites.usa.gov](https://sites.usa.gov/ "sites.usa.gov Program Site") tool, built in WordPress, to run their [Innovations in Hypertension Challenge](http://challenge.sites.usa.gov/challenge/ehr-innovations-for-improving-hypertension-challenge/ "Innovations in Hypertension Challenge"). The **Department of Energy** is using their own website—energy.gov—to accept submissions in their [Microgrid MVP Challenge](http://www.energy.gov/oe/downloads/microgrid-2014-mvp-challenge "Microgrid MVP Challenge"). **NASA** is using Innocentive.com to power their [New Ways to Analyze Climate and Earth Science Data Challenge](https://www.innocentive.com/ar/challenge/9933584 "NASA Data Challenge").

If you need any information about challenge platforms, [let us know](https://challenge.gov/p/contact "Challenge.gov contact us page"). There are many options, including contractors on [GSA&#8217;s Schedule for Challenge and Competition Services (541 4G)](http://www.gsaelibrary.gsa.gov/ElibMain/sinDetails.do?scheduleNumber=541&specialItemNumber=541+4G&executeQuery=YES "GSA Challenge Schedule") and the [sites.usa.gov WordPress tool](http://challenge.sites.usa.gov/ "WordPress tool to run a challenge").
