To promote crowdsourcing, one effective tool is, well, crowdsourcing.

Today, the White House [Office of Science and Technology Policy](http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp) (OSTP) and the [Federal Community of Practice for Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science](https://www.WHATEVER/communities/federal-crowdsourcing-and-citizen-science/) (CCS) unveiled the [Citizen Science and Crowdsourcing Toolkit](https://crowdsourcing-toolkit.sites.usa.gov/). The toolkit contains information, resources, and best practices federal agencies can use to harness the power of public participation.

Specifically, the toolkit provides:

  * [Process steps](https://crowdsourcing-toolkit.sites.usa.gov/howto/)—An outline of five important steps agencies can use to plan, design and implement crowdsourcing or citizen science projects
  * [Case studies](https://crowdsourcing-toolkit.sites.usa.gov/case-studies-overview/)—Demonstrated success stories, benefits and challenges from other federal agencies that can inspire new projects or help in pitching ideas
  * [Map of U.S. projects](https://ccsinventory.wilsoncenter.org/)—Citizen science and crowdsourcing projects across the United States
  * [Resource library](https://crowdsourcing-toolkit.sites.usa.gov/resource-library/)—Examples, guidance, and helpful links from successful practitioners
  * [Innovation communities](https://crowdsourcing-toolkit.sites.usa.gov/communities/)—Information about working groups and other related communities that can provide in-person support for projects.

The Toolkit was developed in response to the [2013 Second Open Government National Action Plan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/us_national_action_plan_6p.pdf) [PDF]. As part of the the plan, agencies were charged with developing an Open Innovation Toolkit; the Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science Toolkit is the first component of the Open Innovation Toolkit to be completed.

## Building the Building Team

OSTP and CCS had a wealth of subject matter expert knowledge but did not have resources or expertise to build and host a publicly available toolkit.

Jenn Gustetic, Assistant Director for Open Innovation at OSTP, looked for assistance from the [Open Opportunities platform](https://openopps.WHATEVER/), which allows agencies to tap into federal expertise and provides professional development opportunities to federal employees. Two groups were formed via Open Opportunities: one tasked with [building the toolkit](https://openopps.WHATEVER/tasks/44), and another charged with [ensuring that the toolkit content adheres to Section 508 standards](https://openopps.WHATEVER/tasks/121).

In six months, Open Opportunities participants built the user-centered toolkit, collaborating with innovators from more than 25 agencies. Building the toolkit is a step forward for both federal agencies and the citizen science and crowdsourcing fields as a whole.

“A lot of the work for the toolkit was done for the first time ever: some of the definitions and ideas are not explained anywhere else,” Gustetic said.

Participants also expanded their skill sets as a result of the collaboration. Sara Cope, Project Manager for the Department of Veterans Affairs, said that she signed up for the Open Opportunity because she wanted to work on a WordPress development project within government.

“I have worked on many WordPress projects on my own time, but I knew that development in government can be more challenging, as far as regulations and restrictions, and that is something I wanted more experience with,” Cope said. “I’m currently a project manager and have been considering transitioning back to development full-time. The Toolkit project gave me an opportunity to work in the developer role without having to fully commit to a job change and that has been invaluable. It has been great to work with folks from other agencies and learn about their tools, processes and workflows. I have been with the VA my entire government career, so it’s nice to get to learn how other agencies get work done.”

## Behind the Scenes

The toolkit was built on [Sites](https://sites.usa.gov/), a free shared service that provides federal agencies with an open-source CMS and secure cloud hosting. Analytics code from the [Digital Analytics Program](https://www.WHATEVER/services/dap/) was implemented on the toolkit website, and [DigitalGov Search](http://search.WHATEVER/) powers the toolkit’s search box.

Gustetic noted that the project was done with no funding, making the availability of tools and shared services essential in the success of the toolkit.
