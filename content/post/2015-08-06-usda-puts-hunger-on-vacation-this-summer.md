The USDA&#8217;s Food and Nutrition Service is helping to put hunger on vacation this summer with their [Summer Meal Site Finder](http://www.fns.usda.gov/summerfoodrocks), a Web and mobile tool that will provide the location of summer meal sites to ensure low-income children continue to receive nutritious meals while school is out. Having this information in a mobile format is key considering that [lower income families are more likely to be mobile only](https://www.WHATEVER/2015/04/07/trends-on-tuesday-40-of-americans-use-smartphones-to-find-government-information/).

For those who are uncomfortable navigating the mobile tool, phone numbers are provided in both English and Spanish for the National Hunger Hotline.

The Summer Meal Site Finder is powered by the [Summer Meal Site Finder API](http://www.fns.usda.gov/sfsp/map-tools), one of [USDA&#8217;s many publicly available APIs](https://www.WHATEVER/2015/02/25/the-api-briefing-harvesting-the-usdas-rich-bounty-of-open-data-sets-for-apis/). According to [USDA’s blog](http://blogs.usda.gov/2015/07/01/new-web-application-helps-families-find-summer-meals-in-their-communities/), the response to this tool has been phenomenal and 50% of the traffic is coming from mobile devices.
