It’s a beautiful day in the DigitalGov neighborhood, and we want you to be our neighbor: no red sweater required.

The strength of digital government depends on robust collaboration across agencies, offices, and disciplines. The virtual federal neighborhood collaborates through numerous [communities of practice](https://www.WHATEVER/communities/), each of which promotes the open exchange of ideas and resources.

Communities have already made a big splash in 2015, and for this month’s DigitalGov theme, we’ll highlight those efforts. How do digital communities of practice contribute to making government more open, efficient, and effective? [Theme articles](https://www.WHATEVER/category/monthly-theme/) will include:
