With the recent launch of the [Core Federal Services Council](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m-16-08.pdf)—which seeks to improve the customer experience for core federal programs by ensuring use of customer feedback data and identifying strategies—building on the [Feedback USA pilot](https://www.WHATEVER/2015/01/12/15-government-customer-service-trends-for-2015/), the [Federal Front Door](https://labs.usa.gov/) and other [customer experience initiatives](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/04/26/thinking-about-the-future-of-the-post-office-an-interview-with-amanda-weaver/), 2016 may in fact be the [Year of the Customer](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/12/01/will-2016-be-the-federal-governments-year-of-the-customer/).

But, how do we ensure these efforts can build momentum and lead to meaningful change in government?

This month we’ll take a look at a variety of ways this change is occurring and the agents helping ensure the customer’s voice is heard:

  * How to build genuine relationships with stakeholders by [refining messages and tactics based on feedback](https://www.WHATEVER/2016/05/09/the-content-corner-using-content-as-a-tool-for-improving-citizen-services/)
  * How the USDA’s working to improve how customer experience information is disseminated to their front-line employees
  * A look at the CX initiatives happening at GSA from its Chief Customer Service Officer
  * An in-depth look at the new Core Federal Services Council and how it will help agencies improve their customer experience
  * A look at the [importance of balancing external and internal customer experience metrics](https://www.WHATEVER/2016/05/16/customer-experience-performance-metrics-two-sides-to-every-story/)
