First, it was party lines. Then, it was the rotary phone. Now, two-in-five (41%) U.S. households have officially said goodbye to landlines, according to a <a title="recent report" href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/wireless201407.pdf" target="_blank">recent report</a> by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&#8217;s National Center for Health Statistics.

If you have been keeping up with previous <a title="mobile trends" href="https://www.WHATEVER/tag/trends-on-tuesday/" target="_blank">mobile trends</a>, you won’t be surprised to learn who has decided to cut the telephone cord:

  * An estimated 39.1% of adults and 47.1% of children lived in wireless-only households in 2013.
  * Nearly two-thirds (65.7%) of 25- to 29-year-olds, are living the wireless-only lifestyle, followed by 59.7% of 30- to 34-year-olds, and 53% of 18- to 24-year-olds.
  * A majority (56.2%) of poor households have no landline service.
  * An estimated 53.1% of Hispanic households live with no landline phone.
  * Even region had an impact on the likelihood that a household would be wireless-only. Only a quarter (24.9%) of Northeasterners reported that they lived with no landline phone, versus more than 40% of households in the Midwest, West and South.

Hopefully, reading these stats made two words come to mind—mobile first. With the number of mobile-only households continuing to rise from year to year, optimizing your agency’s site for the mobile user experience just makes sense.
