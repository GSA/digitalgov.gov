Performance Analytics for Social Media Decision Making. Creating Adaptive Content. Usability Testing. These are just some of the areas of programming we are putting together.

After taking a look at the [most widely attended events in 2014](https://www.WHATEVER/2015/01/23/training-trends-in-2014/ "Training Trends in 2014"), we decided to gather ideas we received from community and program leads for our 2015 events lineup through DigitalGov University (DGU).

We&#8217;ve identified primary needs in each community, but this is just the top of the line-up because we will continue to offer just-in-time training on the things you need when you need it. We will also host [Mobile Around the Horn calls](https://www.WHATEVER/event/mobilegov-community-of-practice-check-in-reveal-december-around-the-horn-call/ "MobileGov Community of Practice Check-In Reveal: December Around-the-Horn Call"), [#SocialGov Summits](https://www.WHATEVER/event/u-s-federal-socialgov-2-years-of-smashing-silos-improving-citizens-services-with-social-media/ "U.S. Federal #SocialGov: 2 Years of Smashing Silos + Elevating Citizen Services with Social Media"), [UX CoP](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/02/03/what-happened-at-our-user-experience-summit-with-slides/ "What Happened at Our User Experience Summit (with slides!)") events and other ongoing events you look forward to attending.
