**About the Disaster Apps Challenge**

> Beginning Wednesday, March 19, 2014, the National Defense University’s <a title="star tides link " href="http://www.star-tides.net/" target="_blank">Center for Technology and National Security Policy (CTNSP)</a> will be launching a Disaster Apps Challenge. From the earthquake in Haiti to the recent typhoon in the Philippines, disaster relief apps have shown great promise when it comes to increasing the efficiency and response time of the humanitarian sector. This contest challenges app developers to find innovative ways to improve and refine existing disaster relief solutions.
> 
> The CTNSP Disaster Apps Challenge encourages developers to build upon an open source disaster relief application that is already being used in the field. The challenge is looking for disaster apps that are well built and useful to a broad range of users. The challenge offers developers the opportunity to demonstrate their application’s value to citizens and first responders.
> 
> A $3,000 cash award will be given to the winner. Second place will receive $1,500 and third place will receive $500. Winners will receive mentoring and feedback on further development of their applications, along with exposure to experts and organizations across the disaster response field.

The competition launches at 12:00 p.m. EST, submissions will be accepted between March 19, 2014 to July 15, 2014.
