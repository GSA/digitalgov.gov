A <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/disruptive_technologies">recent report on Disruptive Technologies</a> from McKinsey & Company predicts a number of evolving technologies that will have the biggest impact in the next decade or so, including for government agencies. Disruptive technologies are those that have the potential to disrupt the status quo, alter the way people live and work, rearrange &#8220;value pools&#8221; and lead to entirely new products and services, the report says.

  Out of the 12 potentially disruptive technologies, the report outlines these as the ones that government should be paying the most attention to:
</p>

  * <p dir="ltr">
      Mobile Internet &#8211; Enabling more efficient delivery of many services and creating opportunities to increase workforce productivity
    </p>

  * <p dir="ltr">
      Automation of Knowledge Work &#8211; Answering unstructured questions so employees or customers without specialized training can get information on their own
    </p>

  * <p dir="ltr">
      Internet of Things &#8211; Allowing businesses and public-sector orgs to manage assets, optimize performance & create new business models
    </p>

  * <p dir="ltr">
      Cloud Technology &#8211; Improving the economics of IT for companies and government & provide greater flexibility & responsiveness
    </p>

<p dir="ltr"> Although 2025 sounds like a long way off, the report says the burden will be on government to create an environment where “citizens can continue to prosper,” as these technologies disrupt their lives.
