One way federal agencies create Mobile Gov products is through third party development. Some agencies use platforms like [Challenge.gov](http://challenge.gov/) to get the word out to developers and there have been 3 mobile app challenge awards so far this year.

  * Last week the [mWomen Design Challenge](http://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/usaid-and-partners-announce-winners-gsma-mwomen-design-challenge) announced winners. Supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), it asked developers to help redefine mobile user experiences for women in resource-poor settings. The winner was &#8220;Sahal Shake&#8221; which gives women control over their phone resources, providing prominent airtime and battery management widgets along with cost-conscious phone sharing and emergency SMS features.
  * The Department of Health and Human Services announced winners of the [Million Hearts Risk Check Challenge](http://challenge.gov/ONC/398-the-million-hearts-risk-check-challenge), which asked developers to create an app to help the millions of Americans at risk for cardiovascular disease take action to improve their health. The winner was [Heart Health Mobile](http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2013pres/02/20130214a.html), which provides information about a person&#8217;s risk for heart disease based on a variety of health factors. You [can see other winners and finalists here](http://challenge.gov/ONC/398-the-million-hearts-risk-check-challenge).
  * The Department of Labor&#8217;s [Worker Safety and Health App Challenge](http://workersafetyhealth.challenge.gov/) asked developers to use publicly available government information (i.e., DOL/OSHA data, NIOSH data, and other online government resources) to educate young workers on the safety and health risks in real work scenarios. The winner was &#8220;[Working Safely is No Accident](http://workersafetyhealth.challenge.gov/submissions/9788-working-safely-is-no-accident)&#8221; and you can see [other winners here](http://workersafetyhealth.challenge.gov/).
