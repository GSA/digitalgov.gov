You should be on this list—the current federal government participants in the <a title="civic hack day" href="http://hackforchange.org/" target="_blank">National Day of Civic Hacking</a>.

There are **15 agencies participating in the event**, primarily in and around the Washington, D.C., area. This is a fantastic compilation of what agencies are doing, but it is not enough. We need more widespread participation across the country. If your office has a regional presence and has data or ideas for technical and design projects they&#8217;d like to contribute, this is a prime opportunity to dip in and see what it is like to work with people outside of government.

**Planning events:**

  * National Science Foundation (NSF) &#8211; Organizing a hackathon at NSF in Arlington.
  * Health and Human Services (HHS) &#8211; Organizing a health-focused hackathon with the Health Data Consortium.
  * Census Bureau &#8211; Potentially organizing a hackathon with the Data Innovation DC group.

**Submitting a challenge, API and/or data set:** 

  * National Institutes of Health (NIH) &#8211; Providing data sets.
  * Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) &#8211; Providing two data sets: Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data set and Consumer Complaint Database. The agency will be drafting a challenge competition around these.
  * Census Bureau &#8211; Providing data and challenge competitions.
  * OpenFEMA & HUD &#8211; Providing a joint challenge and data sets.
  * USAID &#8211; Providing a challenge and API.
  * Small Business Administration (SBA) &#8211; Providing a challenge.
  * NASA &#8211; Open Innovation and OCT drafting a challenge each.
  * GSA&#8217;s Data.gov &#8211; Connecting data communities with challenges and local leads.
  * GSA&#8217;s 18F &#8211; Both offering and supporting a challenge. Also shared their extensive API work.
  * Institute of Museum & Library Sciences (IMLS) &#8211; Providing a challenge.

**Other support:**

  * Peace Corps &#8211; Public outreach support and engaging volunteers at the overseas events. Also providing subject matter expertise to some ongoing development work from previous collaborations.
  * GSA&#8217;s Challenge.gov &#8211; Coordinating post-event coverage to share results of all federally-offered challenges.

**There are currently 117 events in 91 cities around the world, with the goal of improving communities and the governments that serve them. Think about how you can contribute. We invite you to join us!**
