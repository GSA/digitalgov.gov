openFDA [launched today](http://open.fda.gov/update/openfda-innovative-initiative-opens-door-to-wealth-of-fda-publicly-available-data/) and with it the first publicly available dataset—[Drug Adverse Reaction and Medication Error Reports](http://open.fda.gov/drug/event/)—that covers more than 4 million records from 2004 to 2013.

The openFDA team compiled 10 things to help developers use this dataset more effectively, including:

  * [Interactive examples](http://open.fda.gov/drug/event/) created by the openFDA team to give perspective to the data. The example scenarios with queries help teach how to perform different types of searches on the data.
  * [Reference page](http://open.fda.gov/drug/event/reference/) that gives detailed interpretations of what can be expected from the API call.
  * Special openfda section that provides a number of additional data fields, including: [Unique Ingredient Identifier](http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/SubstanceRegistrationSystem-UniqueIngredientIdentifierUNII/default.htm), [National Drug Code](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/ucm142438.htm) and [New Drug Application Number](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/NewDrugApplicationNDA/default.htm).

Check out the entire [openFDA post](http://open.fda.gov/update/ten-things-to-know-about-adverse-events/) to see the entire list. The openFDA team will also be adding additional data whenever a new [Quarterly Data File](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/ucm082193.htm) is posted.
