In 1992, Congress passed [Public Law No: 102-481](https://www.congress.gov/bill/102nd-congress/senate-joint-resolution/166/text), which proclaimed the first full week in October as National Customer Service Week. Customer service is also a [Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goal](http://www.performance.gov/node/3400/view?view=public#overview), tasking agencies to “deliver world-class customer services to citizens by making it faster and easier for individuals and businesses to complete transactions and have a positive experience with government.” Federal agencies are encouraged to participate in Customer Service Week, to share how you’re working to improve service, and to recognize your agency’s customer service stars. Here are some ideas to help you get started.

## Talk Amongst Yourselves

  * Develop and broadcast service level standards (e.g., respond to email within one business day; answer the phone by the 3rd ring; always answer the phone with a smile on your face)
  * Host open houses at offices across the country and invite customers and partners, to show them your appreciation
  * Organize user testing sessions, to bring customers in and test your website and other digital products
