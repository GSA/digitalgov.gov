Nearly three in ten adults (28%) reported reading an e-book in the past year, up from 23% at the end of 2012.

  * Half of American adults now own either a tablet or an e-reader for reading e-content.
  * Most people who read e-books and own a tablet or e-reader also consume e-books on their personal computer and cell phones.
  * Among individuals who read a book in the past year, 47% of those under 30 read an e-book, as did 42% of those ages 30-49 and 35% of readers ages 50-64.
