Available on [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mobile-remm-radiation-emergency/id372600451?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.nih.nlm.sis.remm), and [Blackberry](http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/45722/?lang=en&countrycode=US) platforms, the native application showcases comprehensive information concerning dose estimators and resources to initiate a variety of triages on site without requiring mobile connectivity.

After its April update to 2.0.1, users now have access to management algorithms that provide scenario-based flowcharts to help in treatment decision making. These algorithms are successfully structured to provide instantaneous, organized access to a wide realm of protocols and guidance. In addition, the app also provides:

  * A Scarce Resources Triage Tool that aids in victim distribution if medical facilities become overwhelmed.
  * An alphabetized, encyclopedic Isotopes of Interest list with specific treatment details and other important characteristics, such as the radioactive half-life, exposure pathways, and focal accumulation sites within the body.
  * Quick access to the 3, [FDA-Approved Countermeasures](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/EmergencyPreparedness/BioterrorismandDrugPreparedness/ucm063807.htm) for any internal contamination a victim may possess.
  * Widely-renowned agencies that serve as Emergency Contacts in the event of such a Radioactive or Nuclear emergency, like the [EPA](http://www.epa.gov/rpdweb00/rert/), [CDC](http://emergency.cdc.gov/radiation/), [FEMA](http://www.fema.gov/radiological-emergency-preparedness-program), [NRC](http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/emerg-preparedness.html), and many more.
  * Radiation-Unit conversion tools that allow for conversion equivalence calculations and both SI Unit and Common Unit terminology lists.
  * Videos that can help prepare Emergency Responders and Physicians for these tragedies.
