## 2 a.m. EDT, April 16

Looks like the traffic peak for #TaxDay was around 3:00 pm when 194,301 people were on government sites. We&#8217;re now less than one-quarter of that traffic, and the more regular patterns of top sites are reasserting themselves. We’re talking about YOU, [NASA astronomy picture of the day](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html) and that wonderful one-armed spiral galaxy. Welcome back!

And, it&#8217;s a wrap. Thanks for following along as we explored a day in the federal web.

### The Stats:

Number of people on government websites (as of 2 am EDT, Apr 16): **41,865**

Number of IRS pages that are in the Top 20 pages: **10**

### Fun Facts:

  * We&#8217;re starting to see less traffic per hour than we did yesterday at this same time.
  * Let us know other events that you&#8217;d like to follow in the future. Remember that [analytics.usa.gov](https://analytics.usa.gov) always displays the pulse of federal public web users. It&#8217;s addicting.

## 1 a.m. EDT, April 16

Traffic continues to decrease as the April 15th tax filing deadline fades into the rear-view mirror. People on government sites continue to be interested in tax resources. In other news, [there was a 3.2 earthquake near Pacioma, Calif, north of Los Angeles](//earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/ci37364384#general_summary), as reflected by a new page flitting up and out of the Top 20 this hour.

### The Stats:

Number of people on government websites (as of 1 a.m. EDT, Apr 16): **57,042**

Number of IRS pages that are in the Top 20 pages: **14**

### Fun Facts:

  * ”Where’s My Refund” continues to be a top page (#2 now) into the early morning hours. Hope that these aren’t the people that just filed an hour ago.
  * The U.S. Geological Survey uses crowdsourcing to capture data on the impact of earthquakes. [Learn more about their DYFI (Did You Feel It?) research](//earthquake.usgs.gov/research/dyfi/).

## Midnight EDT, April 16

Hitting the midnight filing deadline on the East Coast finds pages on the top of the list all about more time! Like Form 4868 (AKA &#8220;Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File&#8221;) and a page with information on tax filing extensions (AKA &#8220;Topic 304&#8221;). Nine of the top ten pages right now are on IRS.GOV.

### The Stats:

Number of people on government websites (as of Midnite EDT, Apr 16): **82,637**

Number of IRS pages that are in the Top 20 pages: **16**

### Fun Facts:

  * Folks in other time zones still have time to postmark their returns by midnight. Check out the U.S. Postal Service site to <a href="https://www.usps.com/taxes/" target="_blank">find Post Office locations that are open late</a> to postmark tax returns.
  * It doesn&#8217;t look like we hit [DAP](https://www.WHATEVER/services/dap/ "DAP: Digital Analytics Program") Program Manager Marina Fox&#8217;s prediction of 300,000 realtime views. We&#8217;ll ask for her post-game analysis tomorrow.

## 10:00 Update

IRS websites still make up 15 of the top 20 sites on [analytics.usa.gov](https://analytics.usa.gov/).

When citizens have a good customer experience, [statistics from Forrester Research](http://blogs.forrester.com/rick_parrish/14-11-07-improving_the_federal_customer_experience_is_a_national_security_imperative) show that they are proud of their country and optimistic about its future. Check out our articles this month. The theme is &#8220;[How Federal Contact Centers Deliver Great Customer Service](https://www.WHATEVER/2015/04/08/monthly-theme-how-federal-contact-centers-deliver-great-customer-service/).&#8221;

IRS2Go lets taxpayers check on the status of their tax refund and obtain helpful tax information. If you’re e-filing, you can check your refund status within about 24 hours after the IRS confirms receipt of your tax return.

## 8:00 pm Update

As the West Coast gets out of work the IRS is in total control of the Top 20 government sites being visited at the moment with 15 sites. And in a late surge, [Get Your Electronic Filing Pin](http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Electronic-Filing-PIN-Request) took over the top of the board from [Where’s My Refund](http://www.irs.gov/Refunds) for the first time today. So all procrastinators out there rejoice! You are not alone.

## 7:00 pm Update

Even though the [Where’s My Refund?](http://www.irs.gov/Refunds "Where's My Refund?") page continues leading all government traffic (3,315 visits), those looking for an extension are outpacing them with 3,883 visits divided among those looking for [Form 4868](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f4868.pdf "Form 4868"), reading about the three ways to request an <a title="automatic extension" href="http://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc304.html" target="_blank">automatic extension</a> of time, and <a title="Extension of Time To File Your Tax Return" href="http://www.irs.gov/uac/Extension-of-Time-To-File-Your-Tax-Return" target="_blank">Extension of Time to File Your Tax Return</a>, which provides information about extensions for individual, corporations and others.

If you’ve been following the Analytics Dashboard today, you may have noticed “Application Manager” as one of the top 20 sites throughout the day.

## 5:00 pm Update

Although the overall number of visitors to government websites has decreased since the early afternoon peak, IRS websites have now taken over the top 5 of the Analytics dashboard.

We’ll be continuing our updates throughout the evening and into the night, as the filing deadline gets closer and closer. Will we see an uptick in visits during the final hours? Or, have most people wrapped up their to-do lists for the day?

### The Stats:

Number of people on government websites (as of 5:04 pm): **163,502**
  
Number of IRS pages that are in the Top 20 pages: **14**

### Fun Facts:

  * Not everyone waits until April 15th to file: the **IRS had already received over 99 million returns on April 3rd**, according to the [IRS website](http://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/2-out-of-3-Taxpayers-Have-Already-Filed-Use-Free-File-or-Direct-Pay-to-Get-a-6-Month-Tax-Filing-Extension-E-Pay-and-Payment-Agreement-Options-Available-on-IRSgov). This accounts for 2 out of 3 taxpayers.

## 4:00 pm Update

Did you know that the IRS was an early technology adopter? They first used computers in 1955 to help process over 1 million returns. By 1967 all returns were processed by computers.

### The Stats:

## 3:00 pm Update

In the coming months, the [public dashboard](https://analytics.usa.gov/) will be expanding its reach to report more meaningful metrics across additional dimensions.

To give you a quick taste of what type of information you could get, we are reporting that 90% of the traffic on government websites right now at 3pm ET is coming from the United States, with New York, Washington, Chicago, and Los Angeles leading the way. Trending as the # 1 pdf download across the government websites is the [IRS’s Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f4868.pdf) [PDF] with more than 5,000 people currently downloading the form. More to come on this one as we continue to think through and enhance analytics.usa.gov reporting.

### The Stats:

Number of people on government websites (as of 2:58pm): **194,301**
  
Number of IRS pages that are in the Top 20 pages: **13**

_-Marina Fox, Manager, Digital Analytics Program_

## 2:00 pm Update

The number of real time users is inching closer and closer to 200,000 people. When will we see the surge that hits this mark? This might be our big question of the day, but we see that more than 2,000 people are likely concerned with another question: “What is the weather going to be like today?”

### The Stats:

Number of people on government websites (as of 1:55 pm): **190,622**
  
Number of IRS pages that are in the Top 20 pages: **13**

### Fun Facts:

  * Staring at your tax forms can make you see stars. But you can take a look at real stars via [NASA’s Astronomy Photo of the Da](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html)y, which is consistently in the Top 20 pages on the Dashboard. Today’s photo is &#8220;Mystic Mountain Dust Pillars.&#8221;
  * We’re having fun with data today, but opening government data is valuable on many levels. Our [Wednesday API briefing](https://www.WHATEVER/tag/wednesday-api-briefing/) writer, Bill Brantley, just published an article on [how government data benefits the American economy](https://www.WHATEVER/2015/04/15/the-api-briefing-how-essential-is-government-data-to-the-american-economy/).

## 1:00 pm Update

People are finishing up lunch and still working on their taxes!

### The Stats:

Number of people on government websites (as of 12:58pm): **186,797**
  
Number of IRS pages that are in the Top 20 pages: **13**

### Fun Facts:

  * The number of people on the **“Where’s my Refund Page” has decreased slightly to 4,326 people**. Could the cause be people going to eat lunch?
  * Data! It’s what the Dashboard is all about. [DigitalGov University](https://www.WHATEVER/digitalgov-university/) has hosted several trainings on [analyzing data and writing meaningful reports](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/10/20/metrics-round-up/).

## Noon Update

It’s noon on tax day and the number of people on government websites has more than doubled since we started monitoring at 7:58 this morning.

### The Stats:

Number of people on government websites (as of Noon): **187,930**
  
Number of IRS pages that are in the Top 20 pages: **13**

### Fun Facts:

  * There are **1,935 people getting their electronic filing pin**. I wonder how many of those views are from people on the East Coast filing during their lunch break? Rumor has it that our [Thursday Mobile Product](https://www.WHATEVER/tag/thursday-mobile-products/) blogger Kevin Downey was one of the people on that page earlier.
  * While IRS web traffic is the name of the game today, [this month’s DigitalGov theme is Contact Centers](https://www.WHATEVER/category/monthly-theme/). I can imagine the IRS contact center is getting a lot of phone calls today.
  * I asked the USA.gov Contact Center Team about contact center impact this morning, and they said that IRS information calls are a hot topic year round. On average, **IRS topics are 16% of the [1-844-USA-GOV1 (1-844-872-4681)](http://www.usa.gov/phone.shtml) total volume.** Top IRS topics include tax form requests, tax fraud verification, tax scams and tax refund questions.

## 11:00 am Update

As expected, the number of people on government website is steadily increasing as we get further into the day. People are getting things done today, including their taxes!

### The Stats:

Number of IRS pages that are in the Top 20 pages: **12**

### Fun Facts:

  * There are currently **2,314 people** visiting IRS.gov’s “Forms and Publications” page to find the necessary forms to file their taxes. Can we say &#8220;down to the wire?&#8221;
  * Did you know that IRS.gov is beta testing a new search box on the “Forms and Publications” page, powered by [DigitalGov Search](http://search.WHATEVER/)?

_-Kendrick Daniel, DigitalGov Team_

## 10:00 am Update

Business is booming as we really get rolling on the biggest tax day of the year. We can see another huge jump in total users and across IRS pages.

### The Stats:

Number of people on government websites (as of 9:58 am): **168,671**
  
Number of IRS pages that are in the Top 20 pages: **11**

### Fun Facts:

  * There are currently **3,297 people** on pages related to filing for an extension of the tax deadline.
  * Although today is the last day to file taxes, the top IRS page remains the “**Where’s My Refund**” page with **4,448 active visitors** looking to find out when they’ll receive their refund.
  * Despite IRS dominating the top traffic over the last few months, the usual top performers are weather pages from NOAA, which still has 4 pages in the Top 20 right now. Along with NOAA and IRS, the DAP program has participating sites from 38 federal agencies!
