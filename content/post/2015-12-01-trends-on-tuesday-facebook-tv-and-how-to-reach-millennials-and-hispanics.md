[AdAge](http://adage.com/article/ad-age-research/facebook-top-tv-reaching-millennials-hispanics/300811/) recently analyzed a study from Nielsen’s Homescan panel which found that in a typical month, 12.2% of millennials can only be reached through TV (looking at the top 10 networks only) versus 14.2% who can only be reached on Facebook.

The numbers are similar for U.S. Hispanics: 16.3% can only be reached on TV versus 17.5% who are only on Facebook.

For organizations using both TV and Facebook to reach their audience, the percentages are higher: 69.3% of millennials and 61.2% of Hispanics can be reached by using both platforms.

Erin Sills, director of global consumer insights for Facebook, highlighted the importance of mobile in relationship to these statistics, saying that:

> &#8220;We need to keep in mind that Facebook is largely a mobile platform, and it&#8217;s not that mobile is coming: Mobile is here.”

This research and analysis supports trends highlighted in previous articles on DigitalGov: U.S. consumers are [spending more time in mobile apps than on TV](https://www.WHATEVER/2015/10/06/trends-on-tuesday-the-rise-of-apps-the-decline-of-tv/), mobile users [spend most of their time in social apps](https://www.WHATEVER/2015/10/27/trends-on-tuesday-users-spend-most-of-their-time-in-social-apps/), and Hispanic millennials have long been viewed as a population that not only embraces but will also [shape the mobile future](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/05/27/trends-on-tuesday-hispanic-millennials-provide-insight-on-mobile-future/).
