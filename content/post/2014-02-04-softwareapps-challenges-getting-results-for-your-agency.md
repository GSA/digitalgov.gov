<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Federal agencies are rapidly finding that software and/or app prize competitions have the potential to harness innovative ideas from the public. But as with any type of challenge, software/app competitions bring with them a unique set of aspects to consider before launch.</span>

Brandon Kessler, founder and CEO of [ChallengePost](http://challengepost.com/), was our guest on a DigitalGov University webinar to talk about the things you need to account for in order to run a successful software/app challenge. ChallengePost has hosted many of the top Challenge.gov challenges of the genre (great examples include EPA&#8217;s &#8220;[Apps for the Environment](http://appsfortheenvironment.challengepost.com/)&#8221; and Dept. of the Treasury&#8217;s &#8220;[My Money App Up](http://mymoneyappup.challengepost.com/)&#8220;, among others). As a result, Brandon had some great expertise and insights to share.

Highlights of the discussion include:

  * Making sure the challenge is meaningful to a developer audience
  * Keeping data and/or API documentation clear and user-friendly
  * Developing a smart marketing plan around your challenge
  * Considerations regarding rules such as eligibility, submission requirements, and intellectual property
