The event will be held in the Commission Meeting Room at FCC headquarters and will include panels of industry, consumer, and government representatives. We will also have technology demonstrations in an exhibit area on the same floor. The #AccSocMedia hashtag on Twitter is designated for the event.

We invite expressions of interest from organizations or individuals who may wish to participate in the event as a speaker or exhibitor. Details about the agenda will be added to the following Web page when available: <http://fcc.us/AccSocMedia>.
