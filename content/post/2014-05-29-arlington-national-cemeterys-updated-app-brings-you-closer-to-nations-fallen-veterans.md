While many of us were planning for barbecues or heading to lakes and beaches on the eve of Memorial Day Weekend,  the digital team at [**Arlington National Cemetery**](http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Default.aspx) was busy doing what they do best:  honoring the sacrifices of America&#8217;s veterans with the launch of an upgraded mobile app that helps the public to engage with the history of this sacred site and the fallen who rest there.

Released in time to mark the [Cemetery&#8217;s 150 years of military burials](http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/History/Default.aspx), the **ANC Explorer 2.0** for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/anc-explorer/id562937243?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mil.anc.mobile.android.ext) makes it much easier for users to navigate the Cemetery, plan a visit (or take a virtual one),  search for burial records and find a specific grave site or monument.  Mini-bios for some notable graves — including those of murdered civil rights activist Medgar Evers and nurse Juliet Opie Hopkins, the &#8220;Florence Nightingale of the South&#8221; — provide a more personal and enriching experience.

In addition to graves of loved ones, you can also find locations for everyone from astronauts and prominent explorers to U.S. presidents and Supreme Court justices. Through the app&#8217;s &#8220;Share a post card&#8221; function, Cemetery visitors can e-mail framed photos of monuments or grave markers to those who could not be there themselves. And because Arlington is, after all, an active cemetery, users can get timely information about daily funerals, too.

Memorial Day comes but once a year, but with ANC Explorer App 2.0, you can honor America&#8217;s servicemen and women every month, every day, anytime, anywhere.
