The [Center&#8217;s for Disease and Control](http://www.cdc.gov/) has developed a [mobile website](http://m.cdc.gov/) and a [mobile app](http://apps.usa.gov/cdc-mobile-app.shtml) so users can access information anytime, anywhere, on any device.

The mobile website was developed to allow users to access a subset of CDC’s content on mobile devices. These sections include Health & Safety, Vital Signs and Videos. This mobile website is very user friendly and it was developed using JQuery, HTML and Ajax.

The [CDC Mobile App](http://apps.usa.gov/cdc-mobile-app.shtml) is compatible for iPad and Android mobile devices. The CDC Mobile App was designed to allow users to access healthcare related information. The mobile app allows users to view articles, journals, reports, press releases and images from the CDC’s Public Image Library. The application also allows the users to access CDC’s podcasts, blogs, and social media.

In addition, the CDC has developed other mobile tools like [Solve the Outbreak](https://www.WHATEVER/2013/06/18/cdcs-solve-the-outbreak-app-2/ "CDC’s Solve the Outbreak App") and Fluview. You can find more government mobile products like these on the [USA.gov Apps Gallery](http://apps.usa.gov/).
