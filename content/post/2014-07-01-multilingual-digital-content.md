Federal agencies are required to provide meaningful access to government information to people with limited English proficiency. This applies to your agency&#8217;s digital content too. You need to determine how much information you need to provide in other languages, based on an assessment of your audience.

## The need is increasing

  * The number of people who are not proficient in English is growing dramatically every year. According to the [2010 Census](http://www.census.gov/2010census/), there are approximately 25 million who speak a foreign language at home and whose English-speaking ability is at the level &#8220;less than very well.&#8221; Among Hispanics, 16.5 million speak English &#8220;less than very well.&#8221;
  * The Census Bureau report &#8220;[Language Use in the United States](http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/american_community_survey_acs/cb10-cn58.html)&#8221; (April 2010) identifies the top six non-English languages in the United States as: Spanish, Chinese, French/Creole, Vietnamese, Korean and Russian.
  * Many people who are eligible for federal services can&#8217;t effectively use those services because they aren&#8217;t yet proficient in English.
  * Providing individuals who aren&#8217;t yet proficient in English with easy-to-find government information online encourages their participation in and inclusion into American society.
  * If part of your agency&#8217;s mission is also to provide information to people in other countries, you may need to provide information in other languages specific to that audience.

## Our Mandate

OMB Policies for Federal Public Websites states that &#8220;your agency is already required to provide appropriate access for people with limited English proficiency by implementing Department of Justice guidance for [Executive Order 13166, &#8220;Improving Access to Services for People with Limited English Proficiency](http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/cor/Pubs/eolep.pdf)&#8221; (PDF, 255 KB, 6 pages, August 2000). Agencies must determine whether any individual document on their federal agency public website(s) requires translation.&#8221;

In February 2011, the Department of Justice issued a [memo to federal agencies reaffirming the mandates of Executive Order 13166](http://www.justice.gov/crt/lep/13166/AG_021711_EO_13166_Memo_to_Agencies_with_Supplement.pdf). The memo includes specific steps to help agencies comply with their responsibilities in this area.
