The pursuit of happiness for many of us might mean a fresh new start and a new place to call home.

**But where?**

In such a large and diverse country as ours, the choices can seem endless — and overwhelming.

Now, your [data friendly U.S. Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/) has harnessed the power of its vast trove of demographic, neighborhood-specific and housing information into a new smartphone app on both [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.gov.census.phone.dwellr) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dwellr/id744395884?mt=8) called, aptly, **[dwellr](http://www.census.gov/mobile/?intcmp=sldr1)**.

**How it works**
  
Think of dwellr as the Match.com for people wishing to relocate.

After logging your answers to a series of quick questions based on your location preferences — _e.g., East Coast or Midwest? Rural or mid-size city? Commute on foot or by rail?_ — the app will match you to a Top 25 list of towns and cities you might really like, along with lots of location-based stats on which to base your decision, such as home values, local schools, and more. You can also see how your current neighborhood stacks up to your dream location.

(Another plus: If you’re a developer or tech-savvy tinkerer, you can even swipe dwellr’s cool stats and use them in other apps by accessing [Census’s API](http://www.census.gov/developers/).)

Whether on [Android or iPhone](http://www.census.gov/mobile/?intcmp=sldr1), **dwellr** is an easy, fun and customizable way to find a place to not merely live, but to thrive. Get going and give it a try. Who knows where you’ll end up?

You can find more great government apps like Dwellr in the [USA.gov Apps Gallery](http://apps.usa.gov/).
