Gone are the days when you have to drive miles on a hot and humid afternoon or a cold wintry morning to your local post office to mail your letters, get your stamps or determine how much postage you will need for that package. Technology has become integral to our lives, and now many of these familiar postal services are available at our fingertips on our mobile devices.

Categorized under business, the **USPS Mobile®** app services customers’ postal needs. You can download this app for [iOS (iPhones & iPad)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/usps-mobile/id339597578?mt=8) and [Androids](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.usps&hl=en). The app is user friendly and the intuitive home screen directs customers to available services with eye-catching icons.

So what can this app do for you?

The USPS Tracking tool allows you to check the status of your shipments sent using certain delivery services such as Priority Mail. You are able to nickname your shipments, save them in the app and sign-up for text alerts. Now with the latest version of the app, you can use the device’s camera to scan barcodes on shipping labels, scan [QR codes](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/10/06/trends-on-tuesday-are-qr-codes-still-relevant/) on USPS receipts for easy and convenient tracking of your packages and other mail. The application stores the label numbers so customers can easily re-check the status of their shipments and can stay on top of the status.

The app allows you to calculate domestic or international price to determine how much postage you will need when you ship a letter, card, large envelope or package with some limitations. You can choose retail or online pricing, add any extra services you need and view the total, too.

The app uses your device’s GPS to show your closest options on a map, along with their hours of operation, last collection times and provides mapped results with driving, walking or transit directions.

You are able to lookup the zip-code for any address and schedule a free next-day pickup from your home or office during regular mail delivery. After scheduling a next-day pickup, you will get an email confirmation when you make the request, when your package is picked up or if you modify or cancel your request. For added convenience, the app allows customers to access to their saved contact lists on their device.

There is also the “hold mail” service for keeping your mail at the local post office when you’re away.

Overall, this popular USPS Mobile app may be worthy of your consideration with consistently high store rankings in the business category.
