The [Centers for Disease Control](http://www.cdc.gov) recently added three new outbreaks to their [Solve the Outbreak](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/solve-the-outbreak/id592485067?mt=8) app. CDC released [the app earlier this year](https://www.WHATEVER/2013/02/21/cdcs-solve-the-outbreak-app/ "CDC’s Solve the Outbreak App") to teach users how CDC’s disease detectives save lives everyday. There are now nine outbreaks that players can solve to earn points.

Since it&#8217;s Halloween, I&#8217;ll note that a zombie epidemic is not one of the outbreaks. Most Digital Gov experts might expect some zombies since CDC has a habit of using the living dead as an aid for [teaching us about public health awareness.](http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/19/5/ad-1905_article.htm) This is the agency that brought us the [Zombie Nation campaign](http://blogs.cdc.gov/publichealthmatters/category/zombies/zombie-nation/), pulled [zombie survival lessons from The Walking Dead](http://blogs.cdc.gov/publichealthmatters/2012/02/thewalkingdead/) and even published the graphic novel &#8220;[Zombie Outbreak](http://www.cdc.gov/phpr/zombies_novella.htm).&#8221;

The app itself is no zombie. Solve the Outbreak recently earned 4.5 out of 5 points from a NextGov industry panel, which is the highest score of any app in NextGov&#8217;s [Grading Government Apps](http://www.nextgov.com/media/webgraphics-apps/apps.html) series. The only con from the experts is the app&#8217;s lack of an Android version.

Developers of CDC&#8217;s Solve the Outbreak were featured speakers on our [You&#8217;ll Have Them at Swipe: Make an Awesome Mobile User Experience](https://www.WHATEVER/2013/02/11/youll-have-them-at-swipe-making-an-awesome-mobile-user-experience-webinar/ "You’ll Have Them at Swipe: Making An Awesome Mobile User Experience Webinar") webinar and the team provided input on our recent [Mobile User Experience Guidelines and Recommendations](https://www.WHATEVER/resources/mobile-user-experience-guidelines-and-recommendations/ "Mobile User Experience Guidelines and Recommendations").
