<p>
  <a href="http://www.Challenge.gov">Challenge.gov</a> launched a new feature this week to support agencies in their efforts. The Annual Prize Reporting tool equips agency challenge managers with a one-click tool for downloading key data on their challenges.
</p>

<p>
  How does it work? It’s simple:
</p>

<ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400">
    Log on to Challenge.gov as an agency administrator.
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400">
    Click “Annual Prize Reporting” in your tool menu bar.
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400">
    Select your agency &#8212; “All” will pull a comprehensive report for all challenges run by your parent department or agency, or you can select more specific subcomponent agencies.
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400">
    Select FY16.
  </li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400">
    Click “download” to export data into a CSV file and save to your device.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Exported data will include challenge titles, links and manager POC details as well as key dates, prizes, submissions data, results and other data for incentive prizes hosted on Challenge.gov. These data points can be married with more detailed narratives on each event. (For challenges hosted externally, only information previously entered by your teams on Challenge.gov will be provided.)
</p>

  Each year, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) issues a data call to federal agencies, compiling their inputs on the use and benefits of prize competitions and challenges, and how the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act and other prize authorities are building capacity to help agencies achieve their missions more creatively, efficiently and cost-effectively.
</p>

<p>
  Details are published annually in an Implementation of Federal Prize Authority Progress Report presented to Congress for the preceding fiscal year. The </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/fy2015_competes_prizes_report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400">FY15 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, released in August, outlined 116 prizes offered by 41 agencies in FY 2015.</p>
