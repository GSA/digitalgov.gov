**Best Use of Data:** <a href="https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/earth/aircheck/projects/scintilla" target="_blank">Scintilla</a>, created at the <a href="https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/locations/pasadena-ca-usa" target="_blank">Space Apps Pasadena</a>, California main stage event, mitigates the impact of poor air quality in the global community by democratizing air quality data collection. Leveraging social media and text analysis, the Scintilla web portal collects and displays real time human sentiment on air pollution. Scintilla solves the <a href="https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/earth/aircheck" target="_blank">AirCheck</a> challenge to develop an app or platform to crowd-source data on environmental factors that affect human health.

**Best Use of Hardware:** <a href="https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/space-station/rock-it-space-fashion-and-design/projects/canaria" target="_blank">Canaria</a>, created by a team at <a href="https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/locations/london-england" target="_blank">Space Apps London</a>, is a 3-D printed earpiece designed as a lifeline to the wearer, simultaneously monitoring heart rate, blood oxygen, and atmospheric CO2 levels. Named after the canaries used by Victorian miners as a warning system in areas of dangerous air pockets, Canaria has an audible danger threshold alarm to alert the wearer. Canaria solves the <a href="https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/space-station/rock-it-space-fashion-and-design" target="_blank">Rock-IT Space Fashion and Design</a> Challenge to create out-of-this-world fashion with function that will collect or distribute data through technology to provide interconnectivity, health, or entertainment.

**Best Mission Concept:** <a href="https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/space-station/rock-it-space-fashion-and-design/projects/fractalnet" target="_blank">FractalNet</a>, created at <a href="https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/locations/greensboro-nc-usa" target="_blank">Space Apps Greensboro</a> in North Carolina, is a network of wireless devices to provide communications in a subterranean Earth environment, such as caves or lava tubes on the moon, Mars, or asteroids, where radio communications are not possible beyond short line-of-sight distances. Key to the concept is the Data Glove, the link between mobile nodes and base station. FractalNet also solves the <a href="https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/space-station/rock-it-space-fashion-and-design" target="_blank">Rock-IT</a> challenge.

**Galactic Impact:** <a href="https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/earth/earth-live/projects/l.i.v.e.-glacier-project-ice-cream-team" target="_blank">Live Ice Velocity Estimation (L.I.V.E.) Glacier Project</a>, created at <a href="https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/locations/rome-italy" target="_blank">Space Apps Rome</a> in Italy, is a web tool that provides near real-time visualizations of glacier surfaces, an indicator of climate change, in conjunction with the GLANCY app to collect crowd-sourced glacier photos to support scientific analysis and awareness of environmental impact. L.I.V.E solves the <a href="https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/earth/earth-live" target="_blank">Earth Live</a> challenge to develop a web tool or app to leverage NASA/ESA satellite imagery and climate data to illustrate impacts of our changing Earth.
