  * Mobile app and mobile Web usage have increased by 44% and 38%, respectively
  * Mobile&#8217;s share of digital media time spent is 60%, up from 50% the previous year
  * Desktop usage total time spent declined from 477 billion minutes to 466 billion minutes
  * Time spent on digital increased 20% overall in the past year
