Anytime, Anywhere, Any Device.

The 21st century imperative to deliver government information and services to the public anytime, anywhere and on any device makes mobile a critical tactic in the [federal Digital Government Strategy](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html). Today, GSA’s [Digital Services Innovation Center](https://www.WHATEVER/join-digitalgov/ "Join DigitalGov") and the [Federal CIO Council](http://cio.gov/) launch the [Mobile Application Development Program](https://www.WHATEVER/resources/mobile-application-development-program/ "Mobile Application Development Program") to provide agencies with tools they need to make great mobile products available to the public.

The program&#8211;developed with and by 25 agencies across government&#8211;will help agencies in each stage of mobile development.

  * **Plan** &#8211;Build a mobile strategy, see what other agencies have done, use new acquisitions tools to find top mobile developers.

  *  **Develop** &#8211;Create great mobile apps and sites using mobile user experience guidelines. Jump start development by leveraging pre-existing code.

  *  **Test** &#8211;Make sure your app works on all devices by leveraging automated and in the wild testing support. Test for security & accessibility.

  *  **Launch** &#8211;Let people know yours is an official government app by registering it. Get your app in the app stores and leverage API’s for promoting your apps.

## What’s In It?

The program is chock full of useful resources and tools. For starters there is

  * The [Mobile Code Sharing Catalog](https://www.WHATEVER/2013/05/13/federal-mobile-code-sharing-catalog-is-here/ "Federal Mobile Code Sharing Catalog Is Here") provides agency mobile developers with whole [frameworks for a mobile web site](http://gsa.github.io/Mobile-Code-Catalog/web_html.html), modular code to solve common problems, and open-sourced apps to modify or use as a template. AND, agencies and other developers can [submit code for reuse](https://github.com/GSA/Mobile-Code-Catalog/pulls).

  *  [RFP-EZ](https://rfpez.gsa.gov/government) helps link agencies and small businesses for tech projects below $150,000&#8211;definitely a sweet spot for many mobile products. The idea is to help agencies reach the talent in startups more quickly and at reasonable cost. We worked with the RFP-EZ team at SBA to include mobile statement of work templates. Now when agencies create a new project in RFP-EZ, they can jumpstart their efforts by choosing the “Mobile Application Development” project type.

  * Agencies can easily create mobile ready websites using [Sites.USA.gov](https://www.WHATEVER/services/sites-usa-gov/ "Sites.USA.gov"). This GSA-hosted content management tool supports open content, is secure, compliant and uses only responsive themes that work well on any-sized screen.

The [Federal Apps Registry](https://www.WHATEVER/services/the-federal-mobile-apps-registry/ "The Federal Mobile Apps Registry") helps verify that apps and mobile sites are actually government mobile products&#8211;and provides an API so agencies can easily create galleries around their mission areas.
