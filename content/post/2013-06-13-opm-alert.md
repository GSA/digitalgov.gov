Did that snowstorm (or thunderstorm as the case may be) affect DC feds&#8217; operating status?  Now you’ll know even faster with the [U.S. Office of Personnel Management](http://www.opm.gov)&#8216;s newest mobile app [OPM Alert](http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/snow-dismissal-procedures/mobile-app/). The app features:

  * Real time data on the current operating status for the Federal Government
  * Optional push notifications to alert you whenever status changes occur
  * The ability to review an archive of previous status updates.

Don’t know what to do if the Government is closed? The app also provides Dismissal and Closure procedures for Federal workers in the D.C. area.
