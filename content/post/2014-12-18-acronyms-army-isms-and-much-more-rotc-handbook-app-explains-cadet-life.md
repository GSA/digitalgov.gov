Have a potential future cadet in the family? Deciding whether the Army Reserve Officers&#8217; Training Corps (ROTC) program is right for you? Already in the program?

For current cadets, the app contains an incredible amount of handy reference material, including uniform information, rank and ribbon information, and the army values. The app also features specialized schools available for cadets during the summer or winter, internship information and more.

The app is available for Android devices. It was published in mobile format in partnership with Combined Arms Support Command’s Technology Integration Branch in Ft. Lee, Virginia.
