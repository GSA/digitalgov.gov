As federal agencies release APIs on an almost daily basis, keeping track of the numerous datasets has become a vital service for developers. The Department for Health and Human Services (HHS) manages <a href="http://www.healthdata.gov/" target="_blank">HealthData.Gov</a> which currently lists <a href="http://www.healthdata.gov/dataset/search" target="_blank">1,680 datasets</a> in 36 categories such as “Public Health,” “Health Care Cost,” and “Health Statistics.” To help developers find relevant datasets and keep up with newly-added datasets, the HealthData.gov API was created. Developers can use the <a href="http://www.healthdata.gov/catalog-api" target="_blank">Catalog API</a> to search the catalog and receive meta-information about a dataset in the JSON format.

The HealthData.Gov Catalog API is built on the open source data portal <a href="http://ckan.org/" target="_blank">CKAN</a>. CKAN is designed to list, share, and find datasets for many <a href="http://ckan.org/instances/#" target="_blank">government and non-profit organizations</a>. What makes CKAN especially effective is the built-in API, which, in this case, powers the HealthData.Gov Catalog. Another federal data repository that uses CKAN is <a href="http://www.data.gov/" target="_blank">Data.Gov</a> which uses the <a href="http://www.data.gov/developers/apis" target="_blank">Data.Gov CKAN API</a> for accessing Data.Gov’s catalog.

There are still many federal datasets that need to be released as APIs and federal agencies are working hard to publish government data for app developers and the general public. Thanks to the CKAN API that powers HealthData.Gov and Data.Gov, it&#8217;s easier to discover current and newly-released federal APIs.

_Each week in “The API Briefing,” I will showcase government APIs and the latest API news and trends. Visit this blog every week to learn how government APIs are transforming government and improving government services for the American people. If you have ideas for a topic or have questions about APIs, please contact me via_ [_email_](mailto:%20William.Brantley@opm.gov)_._
