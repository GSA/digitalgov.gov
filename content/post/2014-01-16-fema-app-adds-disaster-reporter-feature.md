The [Federal Emergency Management Agency](http://www.fema.gov) (FEMA) is taking the well-known slogan, &#8220;See something, say something,&#8221;__ to the crowd. Consider it more &#8220;See something, submit something.&#8221;

Harnessing the power of _citizen intelligence_ to understand and respond to disasters, FEMA in late 2013 launched **[a new feature in its iOS/Android app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fema/id474807486?ls=1&mt=8)** that crowd-sources photos of disasters and extreme events.

&#8220;[**Disaster Reporter**](http://www.fema.gov/disaster-reporter)&#8221; enables people to upload photos of disaster scenes with short captions, which, after a quick vetting process, are then plotted by location on an interactive map.  The public, FEMA, emergency management officials, first-responders and others can view the photos instantly during or after an event.

**HOW IT WORKS**

The Disaster Reporter feature relies on users&#8217; smartphone GPS, and the copyright for the photos belongs to the user. FEMA provides would-be citizen reporters a set of instructions about how and what to upload and, most important, advice on how to stay safe when taking disaster photos.

As you might recall, [FEMA&#8217;s app](http://apps.usa.gov/fema-mobile.shtml) also offers users disaster safety tips, an interactive emergency kit list, emergency meeting location information, and a map plotted with open shelters and FEMA Disaster Recovery Centers.

So, [build your emergency  kit](http://www.ready.gov/build-a-kit), develop an [emergency plan](http://www.ready.gov/make-a-plan), and if disaster strikes in your neck of the woods,  consider sending your images through Disaster Reporter as a way to assist recovery and relief operations.
