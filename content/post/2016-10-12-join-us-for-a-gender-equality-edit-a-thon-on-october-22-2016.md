Help us improve Wikipedia entries related to gender equality with the National Archives and Records Administration. You do not need to have prior experience editing Wikipedia. During the event we will have an introduction to editing Wikipedia and a discussion of World War I Nurses and Red Cross records in the National Archives. It will be a lively discussion of women in the Historical record.

This event is part of the [Amending America Initiative](https://www.archives.gov/amending-america/) at the National Archives in celebration of the 225th anniversary of the Bill of Rights. This event is also co-sponsored with [Wikimedia DC](https://wikimediadc.org/wiki/Home) and part of DCFemTech’s [Tour De Code 2016](https://dcfemtech.github.io/tourdecode) and in connection with our celebration of [American Archives Month](https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2016/10/01/the-national-archives-celebrates-american-archives-month/).
