Summer is here, which means it is time for the biggest holiday of the summer—Fourth of July! Independence Day is a happy time of year: BBQs, picnics, pools, sunshine and fireworks. Of course, the foundation of our celebration is American history, and there are plenty of excellent federal apps focused on this area.

The [American Battle Monuments Commission](http://www.abmc.gov/) maintains 25 overseas military cemeteries that honor the service and sacrifices of U.S.armed forces service members. There are three apps they have posted in the [USA.gov Federal Mobile Apps Directory](http://www.usa.gov/mobileapps.shtml):

  * Pointe du Hoc ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/hk/app/pointe-du-hoc/id583152468?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D2), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.neotreks.pointeduhoc&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5uZW90cmVrcy5wb2ludGVkdWhvYyJd))
  * Cambridge American Cemetery ([iOS,](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cambridge-american-cemetery/id965887167?mt=8) [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.abmc.cambridge))
  * Normandy American Cemetery ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/normandy-american-cemetery/id953276481?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.abmc.normandy))


{% include image/full-width.html img="https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/2015/06/250-x-375-National-Archives-Todays-Document-app-home-screen.jpg" alt="Home screen of the National Archives' Android app for Today's Document" %}The [National Archives and Records Administration](http://www.archives.gov/) offers the Today’s Document app ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/todays-document/id412969819?mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.accella.nationalarchives)), an interactive gallery that displays a significant historical document or photo each day of the year. For those who are looking for a self-guided experience, the DocsTeach app ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id513465174)) allows users to choose a historical topic and challenge themselves with an activity provided by the app.

The [Smithsonian Institution](http://www.si.edu/) is a curator of history in many forms, and apps are one way they reach the public. They offer numerous apps, but here are two that you may not have heard of:

  * The [National Postal Museum](http://postalmuseum.si.edu/)’s MagnifAR app ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/it/app/magnifiar/id888013582?l=en&mt=8)) adds to the experience of both in-person and faraway visitors. Those who come in-person can point their phones at selected objects to get an enhanced experience; from the comfort of home, users can point their mobile devices at the NPM website on their computer screen.
  * If you want to get a sneak peek of the new [National Museum of African American History and Culture](http://nmaahc.si.edu/) before it is completed, check out the NMAAHC app ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/it/app/view-nmaahc/id626274903?l=en&mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.secondsitellc.NMAAHC)). This app provides you with a 360 degree rendering of the new museum.
