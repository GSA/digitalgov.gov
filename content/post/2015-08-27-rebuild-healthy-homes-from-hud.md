The [United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) report](http://www.unisdr.org/files/42814_2015no04.pdf), released in March 2015, states that economic losses from disasters are now reaching an average of $250 billion to $300 billion, annually. While the U.N. report is a “wake up” call to strengthen worldwide resilience to disasters, our immediate focus should be on lessening the severity of the impact they have on our homes and everyday life.

When natural disasters destroy the peace, tranquility and harmony of our homes, we need to work quickly to rebuild our lives. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)’s Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes has released “Rebuild Healthy Homes,” a mobile app that provides valuable information that helps us rebuild a safe haven for our families.

The app is free and available for download at [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.hud.healthyhomes) for Android and at [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rebuild-healthy-homes/id980660616?mt=8) for iPhone and iPad. The app is intuitive and provides information about various disaster types and the damages they may cause along with restoration tips.

Information covers the principles and technical aspects of the safe and proper response and removal of mold, radon, asbestos, lead and other hazards and unsafe conditions. The search functionality allows you access to detailed information based on keywords.

The application and the accompanying guide provide a vast array of resources and information for consumers and “DIY”-ers. The Rebuild Healthy Homes guide and publication can be downloaded free of charge within the app.

The app focuses on useful criteria for volunteers, professionals, and others involved in the restoration process. The app has the option to use location information and GPS services to serve up customized resources and services in the vicinity. This feature can be especially useful when we are relying heavily on the mobile phone for communication and recovery from natural disasters.

The Rebuild Healthy Homes app serves as a “how-to” guide while incorporating healthy homes principles and concepts.
