A few weeks ago, the [Go.USA.gov](https://go.usa.gov/) URL shortener introduced several new features to improve the user experience. Go.USA.gov now offers users faster speeds and downloadable metric information about their links.

The service, which launched in 2009, gives government agencies the ability to provide trustworthy shortened links to their audience.

Just a few weeks ago, we finished completely re-engineering the back-end of the site to fix the slow speeds.

Additionally, the back-end improvements have allowed us to re-enable the CSV export function that was taken [offline back in 2010](http://go.usa.gov/node/10?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery).

To help users get even more accurate metrics, we also implemented a frequently requested feature: Click metrics now exclude most search engine bot traffic.

To learn more about the new features, [check out our post on Go.USA.gov](http://go.usa.gov/node/71).
