The [General Services Administration](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100000?utm_source=OCM&utm_medium=print-radio&utm_term=&utm_campaign=shortcuts) has made a mobile version of its [eBuy website](https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov/mobile/login). The mobile site provides ease of access to small businesses and customers to keep an eye on new bidding opportunities and other  information associated with their contract(s) while on the go.

One of the features of the mobile site is that it provides push notifications via SMS messages that will alert the users/contractors based on:

  * Award/No Award
  * eBuy Outage – RFQ/RFI Extension Notices
  * New Request for Quote (RFQ)/Request for Information
  * Modified RFQ/RFI
  * Cancelled RFQ/RFI
  * Received Quote

To receive these notifications, contractors must register their cell phone number [here](https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov/advantage/ebuy/start_page.do).

You can view other mobile products like the [eBuy website](https://www.ebuy.gsa.gov/mobile/login) on the [USA.gov Apps Gallery](http://apps.usa.gov/).
