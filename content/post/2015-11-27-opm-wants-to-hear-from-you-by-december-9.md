The study will review the &#8220;current classification and qualification standards for public affairs work&#8221; and allow OPM to make any revisions or updates. OPM is interested to learn from agencies how public affairs work has changed since the current position classification standard was issued in 1981.

Interested SMEs can send their name, agency, email and telephone information to [Riconda Fortson](mailto:riconda.fortson@opm.gov).
