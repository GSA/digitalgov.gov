_Note: This is a guest blog post by Amando E. Gavino, Jr., Director, Office of Network Services, ITS/FAS/GSA. He is responsible for a portfolio of telecommunication acquisition solutions that provide government agencies the ability to meet their diverse set of telecommunication requirements. Acquisition solutions include Networx, Enterprise Infrastructure Solutions – EIS (the future replacement for Networx), SATCOM, Enterprise Mobility, Connections II, Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative – Wireless (FSSI-W), and the Federal Relay Service._

Many of you are aware that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued the [Mobile Services and Devices memo](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_20.pdf) on August 4, 2016. The intent is to vastly enhance acquisition and management of mobile services and devices across government.

## Resources and Tools Are Available to Help Agencies

Agencies saw an early draft of the memo and now that it’s final, it’s a great time to review resources available to support every agency in achieving the goals set forth by and in the spirit of the OMB memo.

**Leverage Government-wide Acquisition Strategies** – Resource number one is [the existing Government-wide GSA mobile solution](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100931). It gives agencies a variety of service plan and device options from leading national wireless carriers. Information about the program and how to order is available on the [GSA website](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100931).

Another resource is GSA’s [Wireless Economic Model](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/225319) downloadable Excel-based spreadsheet to give agencies a rough order of magnitude concerning your estimated costs and savings when using new wireless service plans. In addition, a [Wireless Guide](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/getMediaData?mediaId=251607) is available to help agencies move from existing contracts and carriers with step-by-step instructions. You can also access a [User’s Guide](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/getMediaData?mediaId=173843), [FSSI Wireless Ordering Template](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/getMediaData?mediaId=251603), and [ordering instructions](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/getMediaData?mediaId=235527). For more resources and templates, visit the [Enterprise Mobility Resources](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/225655) web portal.

**Optimize Plan Pricing and Device Refresh Schedules** – When it comes to OMB’s directive to optimize pricing, the [GSA mobile solution](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100931) has a strong three-year track record of success in optimizing plans and cost savings. About 85% of defense and civilian cabinet-level agencies are using FSSI Wireless Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs), achieving a government total $29 million savings compared to prior rates since the May 2013 FSSI-W award. Agencies that have moved to the existing government-wide FSSI mobile solution find average cost savings of 27% compared to previous wireless service costs. These agencies pay on average $14 less per unit per month. As a reminder, the BPA published prices differ from the actual service prices agencies have negotiated when using the FSSI-W BPAs so please check with us to get prices paid information when you are making comparisons. You’ll find that it’s hard to beat the prices we’ve achieved for the features in the service plans offered.

Carriers include devices at no cost with service plans and users have a choice of devices with each service plan. In accordance with OMB’s guidance, previous generation devices are typically equally capable of meeting government requirements and can be acquired at significantly lower prices. Agencies also have the option to buy service plans for government-furnished equipment (GFE) and user-owned devices.

Scheduling device refreshes is flexible too. No-cost device refreshes happen based on commercially available cycles of 10 to 20 months, although agencies can determine a refresh schedule that works best for their users.

**Baseline Agency Usage and Quarterly Reports** – Once an agency uses the [existing Government-wide GSA mobile solution](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100931), the built-in requirements for carriers to provide usage reports will assist in agency quarterly reporting. These reports can help agencies to analyze usage and optimize mobile service levels, including identifying and terminating unused (or zero-use) devices and services. The pooling option for data and minutes saves dollars for agency customers by allowing agency high-volume users to leverage purchased and unused minutes and data from lower volume users.

**Optimize Agency Requirements** – The OMB memo also addresses actions agencies must take to consolidate contracts, track and improve inventory of mobile devices, and pool mobile services to avoid overage charges. Depending on size, agencies using the [existing government-wide FSSI mobile solution](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100931) can choose to consolidate wireless contracts at the bureau level and then into one enterprise-wide agency contract. Smaller agencies might fully consolidate initially without phases.
