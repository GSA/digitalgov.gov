The <a href="http://www.faa.gov/mobile/" rel="nofollow">FAA launched a mobile site</a> to cater to the needs of its users on the move.

## <a name="x-Why We Did It"></a>Why We Did It {#toc0}

Mobile traffic to FAA.gov grew from 1.5 million to 4.4 million visits over the past two fiscal years. To address this rising demand, FAA Mobile was developed to help our website customers complete popular tasks on small-screen devices.

## <a name="x-What We Did"></a>What We Did {#toc1}

We leveraged our metrics, American Customer Satisfaction Index reporting and months of user feedback to determine what would be featured in this initial release and optimized that data and content accordingly.

## <a name="x-How It Worked"></a>How It Worked {#toc2}

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. One quick note: We obviously have a very niche audience; most of our demographic consists of pilots, aviationmechanics and aviation enthusiasts.

## <a name="x-What We Learned"></a>What We Learned {#toc3}

Because our target audience is such a niche group, our content should be featured towards this groups such as pilots, aviation mechanics, and others. A lot of our audience is on the move, hence we created a site that is easily accessible on mobile devices because a large part of our audience is on the move a majority of the time.

## <a name="x-What's Next"></a>What&#8217;s Next {#toc4}

Next up &#8211; enterprise level content management for FAA.gov and our employee destinations!
