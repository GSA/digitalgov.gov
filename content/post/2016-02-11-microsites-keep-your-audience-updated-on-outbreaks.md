You can now help your audience stay up-to-date on the Zika virus outbreak—and others—through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s microsite, which is an [easily embeddable collection of virus information](https://tools.cdc.gov/medialibrary/index.aspx#/microsite/id/234558) for your agency’s website.

The Zika Virus Microsite is automatically updated on your site in real time as CDC updates [existing Zika Web pages](http://www.cdc.gov/zika/), according to the CDC. Staying current is made easy and maintenance-free.

The microsite is built with Zika content, however the CDC now has the ability to quickly assemble additional embeddable collections that you can use on your site. These new microsites have their own navigation and all the internal cross-links will stay on your site, in your own websites’ look and feel. Soon this will be the default behavior for all of our content collections available in the Public Health Media Library, allowing you to embed collections for observance months and specific topics, as well as outbreaks.
