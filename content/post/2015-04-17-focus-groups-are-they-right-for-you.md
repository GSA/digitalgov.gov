The short answer is: it depends on your goals. If you Google “focus group,” you will have a host of positive and negative feedback, but the truth is that it depends on what your needs are.

## What Is a Focus Group?

Focus groups are an inexpensive way to identify people’s preferences, motivations, thoughts, feelings and attitude towards a product or service. In a typical focus group, approximately 6 to 10 people spend 60 to 90 minutes voicing their opinions about your website or application. They differ from usability studies in that they show participants’ attitudes towards a particular item, whereas usability studies reveal how things are used.

## When to Use

Conducting a focus group early in a project is a way to get a sample of opinions. It is also helpful to conduct a focus group towards the end of a project, when you want to check in about meeting your goals.

## After Conducting Your Focus Group

Once you have completed your focus group, validate and explore results with users one-on-one by conducting user research interviews and usability studies. Focus groups are considered a good start to triangulation, which is the practice of combining different methods of research to develop a complete picture of your user and the challenges they have using your product.

If you have decided that conducting a focus group is a good idea for your project, the following resources will make you a focus group ninja:
