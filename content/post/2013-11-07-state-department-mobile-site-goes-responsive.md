The [Department of State](http://www.state.gov/) has updated their mobile website [m.state.gov](http://m.state.gov) with responsive design.  The site auto-detects mobile devices and displays the State mobile site by default.

State&#8217;s mobile site provides the latest foreign policy information from the State Department. Included are recent stories from the Secretary’s travels, the daily press briefing, country fact sheets, human rights reports, and more.

[Responsive design](https://www.WHATEVER/tag/responsive-web-design/) is becoming a popular means of creating a single site that can display nicely on a range of device sizes.
