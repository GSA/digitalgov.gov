That’s how frequently someone died in crashes involving a drunk driver in the U.S. in 2013—10,076 deaths in total. While that number represents a 2.5% reduction in deaths from the previous year, the <a href="http://www.nhtsa.gov/About+NHTSA/Press+Releases/2014/SaferRide-app-and-new-data-highlight-holiday-drunk-driving-crackdown" target="_blank">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is offering a new mobile app</a>—called SaferRide—to save more lives.

Simply put, SaferRide helps people who have been drinking to get a safe ride home.

The app helps keep drunk drivers off the road by allowing users to call a taxi or a pre-programmed friend, and also helps easily identify the user’s current location. The app has a very streamlined function, and its interface is purposefully simple. The app only has three large buttons on the home screen: “Get Taxi,” “Call Friend,” and “Where Am I?”

  * Choose from a list of available taxi services in your area, and call with the tap of a button.
  * Call a pre-programmed contact.
  * Call up a map of your current location.

The app’s simple interface belies the amount of design and development time that went in to making it extremely useful. For instance, [the app pulls in data from Yelp](https://www.WHATEVER/2015/01/26/new-nhtsa-app-uses-yelp-api/ "New NHTSA App Uses Yelp API")—a social network that connects people with local business—to get local taxi information.

There’s never any excuse to drive after drinking, and now it’s never been easier to help end drunk driving. Use NHTSA’s SaferRide app to get home safely.

The app is available [on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nhtsa.SaferRide) for Android devices, and Apple’s [iTunes store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/saferride/id950774008?mt=8) for iOS devices.
