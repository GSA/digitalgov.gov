## 1. Meet all Laws, Requirements, Policies, and Directives for Federal Contact Centers

  * Understand and follow all [Privacy, Security, Disability, and Service Contract Act](https://www.WHATEVER/2013/10/28/federal-contact-center-regulations-and-directives/ "Federal Contact Center Regulations & Directives") requirements.

## 2. Use Performance Metrics to Influence Business Rules and Drive Improvements

  * Develop [Key Performance Indicators/Metrics](https://www.WHATEVER/resources/contact-center-guidelines/getting-started-with-your-contact-center/ "Getting Started with your Contact Center") (see Performance Goals).
  * [CSLIC](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/2014/01/citizen-service-levels-interagency-committee-final-report1.docx) could be used as a start.

## 3. Develop and Use a Comprehensive Quality Assurance Program

  * [Monitor quality](https://www.WHATEVER/resources/contact-center-guidelines/contact-center-operation-and-management/ "Contact Center Operation and Management").
  * Use data to provide feedback to website/content team.
  * Compare Quality Assurance scores to Customer Satisfaction scores to ensure they are similar.

## 4. Implement a Content Strategy

  * Develop content guidelines ([plain language](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/2014/01/plain-writing-checklist.pdf), accessibility, etc.)
  * Institute a content review process (including a schedule and checklist for quality and functionality).
  * Use FAQs or a [knowledgebase](https://www.WHATEVER/resources/contact-center-guidelines/contact-center-technologies/ "Contact Center Technologies").
  * Develop pre-formatted responses (canned/scripted answers) for email, chat, social media, etc.

## 5. Focus on Top Tasks and Make the Most Important Content Easy to Find

  * Determine top tasks. 
      * Review data (reports, website traffic, Interactive Voice Response (IVR) usage, etc.)
      * Review Customer Satisfaction data
      * Survey front-line agents
  * Evaluate if top tasks can be accomplished through self-service (website, IVR).
  * Ensure FAQs are on your website.
  * Use a [knowledgebase system](https://www.WHATEVER/resources/contact-center-guidelines/contact-center-technologies/ "Contact Center Technologies") that automatically moves most-requested info to top.
  * [Arrange IVR messages](https://www.WHATEVER/resources/contact-center-guidelines/contact-center-technologies/ "Contact Center Technologies") in order of popularity (most-requested info is heard as first menu choice).
  * [Use the same language as your customers](http://www.plainlanguage.gov/howto/guidelines/FederalPLGuidelines/index.cfm?CFID=838730&CFTOKEN=f64d36ad05e03d58-ED6E6827-0361-55F8-E6207170C554B1DF&jsessionid=A3A593B93EAEE361431FC8D8B4799DF0.chh). Avoid using government acronyms, which customers may not understand. (For online FAQs, consider hidden keywords).

## 6. Engage Your Customers to Create a Two-Way Dialogue

  * Provide blogs, communities, and outreach via other [social media](https://www.WHATEVER/category/socialmedia/) venues.
  * Incorporate [videos](https://www.WHATEVER/category/content/video/) and webcasting.

## 7. Collect Customer Feedback

  * Use a Customer Satisfaction Survey. 
      * Don&#8217;t ask leading questions.
      * Review the Basics of Survey and Question Design
      * Allow for additional comments from customers.
      * Restrict the number of questions to seven.
      * Survey everyone; not just the happy or unhappy customers
  * Conduct focus groups to gauge opinions.
  * Implement [usability testing](http://https://www.WHATEVER/category/ux/user-testing-research/) to determine what is and isn&#8217;t working.
  * Conduct interviews, workshops.

## 8. Stay Current with the Latest Research and Best Practices

  * Attend training through courses, workshops, webcasts, and [webinars](https://www.WHATEVER/communities/government-contact-center-council-g3c/ "Government Contact Center Council (G3C)") to gain knowledge about latest information, methods, policies, and best practices.
