GSA unveiled a refreshed GSA.gov website yesterday with a more crisp design layout, improved usability, and features geared more toward mobile users.

Increasingly, website traffic is coming from mobile users. With this in mind, GSA unveiled a newly refreshed [GSA.gov](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100000) website on Nov. 16.

“Our ultimate goal for the refresh was to continue our work to get important government information into the hands of users–no matter how or where they’re accessing the information,” said Sarah Bryant, Director of GSA’s Enterprise Web Management Team within the Office of Communications and Marketing. “With the focus on mobile users, the refreshed GSA.gov is another step toward anticipating the future needs of our customer agencies to make smarter, more strategic decisions that provide better value to our stakeholders.”

The website refresh is also using resources from the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/), which were [released by U.S. Digital Service and 18F earlier this fall](https://www.WHATEVER/2015/09/28/introducing-the-u-s-web-design-standards/). The U.S. Web Design Standards are designed to create better online experiences for the American people. The standards include typography and color scheme recommendations that are 508 compliant, flexible, and designed for ease of readability in addition to interface elements and the code that powers them. By using these standards, we are ensuring that the individuals visiting GSA.gov will have a better digital experience.

In addition to a section highlighting the most requested GSA services and information, the revamped GSA.gov also showcases a host of user engagement platforms including upcoming events, news, and customer support.

On average, GSA.gov receives more than 5 million page views a month.

Other features of the refreshed GSA.gov include:

  * Modernized design and layout for top-level pages and a new color palette for standard pages.
  * Responsive design for the majority of pages to automatically scale them to display on mobile devices.
  * New top-menu navigation that eliminates ambiguous labels and provides better visibility for top tasks.
