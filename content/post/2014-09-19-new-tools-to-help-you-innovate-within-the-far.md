Outdated development practices and narrow interpretations of acquisition regulations have prevented the federal government from taking advantage of technologies that can help agencies deliver better digital services to the public.

OMB is developing new tools to help you take advantage of existing procurement authorities in the FAR, or the Federal Acquisition Regulation, the nearly 2,000 page bible that guides federal purchasing, including:

  * [TechFAR Handbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/techfar/) (highlights flexibilities in the FAR)
  * [Innovative Contract Case Studies](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/innovative_contracting_case_studies_2014_-_august.pdf) (describes how agencies are getting more innovation per tax dollar, under existing laws and regs)

Take a look at these tools and share them with your contracting officers.

You can also get involved by providing feedback, sharing experiences and strategies that can help the federal marketplace evolve:

  * Join the [public discussion forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/procurement-innovation) on innovative government procurement practices
  * Sign-up for the feds-only [“Buyers Club” email group](https://listserv.gsa.gov/cgi-bin/wa.exe?SUBED1=BUYERS-CLUB&A=1) (designed to troubleshoot and share best practices for everyone from contracting officers and program managers)
