Things you don&#8217;t know about this website, DigitalGov.gov, that is. It’s our first birthday, and we’re celebrating by sharing some fun facts with you. A more sober [look at our strategy can be read on our 6-month post](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/09/12/digitalgov-gov-six-months-later/), but this is a party post! w00t!

10.  We’ve published an impressive 480 articles and counting (this post is like #485), and we are learning more and more about you. You [still](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/09/12/digitalgov-gov-six-months-later/) love posts on [metrics](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/03/04/creating-awesome-web-analytics-reports-and-presentations/ "Creating Awesome Web Analytics Reports and Presentations") and on [customer service](https://www.WHATEVER/2013/12/02/whats-your-strategy-operational-excellence-product-leadership-or-customer-intimacy/ "What’s Your Strategy? Operational Excellence, Product Leadership or Customer Intimacy?"), but “[Government Open and Structured Content Models are Here](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/05/05/government-open-and-structured-content-models-are-here/ "Government Open and Structured Content Models Are Here!")”? We didn’t know you were that deliciously nerdy!

9.  We swapped over to DigitalGov Search from the native WordPress search for better searching of tags and authors, but also because we plan to use feeds from our tags to revamp the [currently messy, non-scalable Resources page](https://www.WHATEVER/resources/ "Resources"). Don’t believe us, just watch!

8.  Articles on DigitalGov.gov have informed the research agenda for Deloitte, Gartner and Forrester. It’s where all the smart people go to learn about trends and practices, don’t you know?

7.  People love behind the scenes stuff. So, under the hood, DigitalGov.gov uses the WordPress-Enlightened theme with some clever CSS hacks and is hosted on [sites.usa.gov](https://sites.usa.gov). Yes, we are eating our own dogfood—or maybe drinking our own champagne! #betteranalogy

6.  The project to combine four related properties into DigitalGov.gov was initiated in September 2013. Just after we convened our internal team&#8211;WHOMP!, the government shut down for most of October. We picked back up and soft launched in three months: design, UI content integration, build. Yes, we roll that hard.

5.  We’ve only been “visited” by legal once. But that was a four attorney alarm! Hot!

4.  The death of e-mail is greatly exaggerated. We get as much traffic from subscriber emails as we do from Google. Also, our referrals from social media continues to grow. At the risk of sounding like Sally Field at her Oscar win: [Follow us](https://twitter.com/Digital_Gov "Digital Gov on Twitter")!

3.  Less than 4% of you use the site search. “Terms of Service” is your #1 query, but you are more likely to search for three of our authors than for “responsive Web design.” Hmmmmm.

2.  Comments!?! The community listserves ([you can sign up from here](https://www.WHATEVER/communities/)) are a-buzz with comments and sharing, but we just don’t see that much discussion on posts. We’re not intending on [turning them off](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/05/29/why-we-turned-off-comments-on-the-usa-gov-blog/ "Why We Turned Off Comments on the USA.gov Blog"), but it&#8217;d be nice to hear from you once in a while.

1.  While we owe everyone who has written for DigitalGov.gov a piece of birthday cake, since we don’t bake, we are going to wish that someone brings them all cake.
