Sign up now to watch the [DigitalGov Summit](https://www.WHATEVER/event/2015-digitalgov-citizen-services-summit/ "Spring 2015 DigitalGov Citizen Services Summit") from the comfort of your desk!

Virtual attendance will be an awesome way to experience the event with extras not offered to in-person attendees. Bernetta Reese from the U.S. Department of Agriculture will be our host and MC for virtual attendees. There will also be a dedicated Q & A with presenters, and interviews during the expo. Those of you across the country don’t have to worry about missing out on this stimulating ½ day event.
