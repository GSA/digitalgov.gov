The federal government&#8217;s [Mobile Code Catalog](http://gsa.github.io/Mobile-Code-Catalog/) has company! This month, NASCIO released a new State Mobile Apps Catalog, a collection of over 160 state and territory native mobile apps that users can browse and download for smart phones and tablets. The apps are searchable by state/territory, by category and through an overall browse function. Visit<span style="font-family: Arial Narrow"> </span>[www.nascio.org/apps](http://www.nascio.org/apps) to look through the topics or upload your state&#8217;s native apps.

&#8220;This tool offers a convenient way to see what other states are producing in terms of mobile apps, and allowing states to generate ideas for their own state or territory,&#8221; said Brenda Decker, NASCIO president and Nebraska CIO. &#8220;Some states lead the way in mobile app development and can pose as models for those growing their mobile app capabilities.&#8221;
