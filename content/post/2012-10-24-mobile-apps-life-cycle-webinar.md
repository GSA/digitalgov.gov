Are you creating a mobile website or app for your agency? On Tuesday, October 30, at 11 a.m. we will host a webinar to get agencies thinking about how they can prepare for the entire life cycle of their mobile products—from planning&#8211;to implementing&#8212;to continually updating and upgrading. This webinar will feature 3 agencies giving their stories in these 3 &#8220;phases&#8221; of the cycle.

First, the U.S. State Department will discuss the issues around planning mobile app development. Then the U.S. Census Bureau will talk about the implementation of their new app, &#8220;[America&#8217;s Economy](http://apps.usa.gov/america's-economy.shtml).&#8221; Finally, the Transportation Security Administration will share their experience with upgrading the [MyTSA app](http://apps.usa.gov/tsa-app.shtml) since it&#8217;s implementation.
