“There’s an app for that.” New data from [app analytics provider Flurry](http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/01/mobile-app-usage-increases-in-2014-as-mobile-web-surfing-declines/?ncid=rss&utm_content=buffer076ba&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) on mobile app usage reveals that smartphone users are taking this trademarked slogan to heart. Of the 2 hours and 42 minutes per day that a typical user is on a mobile device, mobile app usage accounts for 2 hours and 19 minutes of that time. In other words, app usage accounts for nearly 86 percent of time spent on a mobile device.

**App Stat Highlights:**

  * Gaming remains the most popular app category of mobile usage with 32% of time spent (same as last year), while Facebook comes in second with 17% of time spent on mobile.
  * Social Messaging apps, including Facebook and Twitter, grew to 28% of time spent on mobile, an increase of 4 percentage points from the previous year.
  * Productivity apps doubled their share from 2% to 4%.
  * Browsers lose share, most notable decline is Safari, which dropped from 12% to 5%. Non-Google, non-Apple browser dropped from 4% to 2%.
  * Google and Facebook apps accounted for 34.7% of time spent yet brought in 63.8% of ad revenues.

The data above show that the [App vs. mobile web debate will continue](http://www.clickz.com/clickz/column/2343327/apps-and-mobile-web-the-state-of-the-debate?amf_cntctid=6862549&utm_term=&utm_content=Apps%20and%20Mobile%20Web%3A%20The%20State%20of%20the%20Debate&utm_campaign=CZ.Media.Cat.EU.A.U&utm_medium=Email&utm_source=CZ.DCM.Editors_Updates) but [mobile first](https://www.WHATEVER/2013/09/30/mobile-first/) is a must for federal agencies. No matter where an agency is in their mobile application plan, they must take a proactive approach if they want to engage mobile web users. For example, having a robust social media presence or advertising on popular gaming apps are ways agencies that are still developing a [mobile app plan](https://www.WHATEVER/resources/mobile-application-development-program/) can leverage this trend. If your agency already has an app(s), you can increase visibility with mobile users by becoming part of the [Federal Mobile Apps Registry](https://www.WHATEVER/services/the-federal-mobile-apps-registry/).
