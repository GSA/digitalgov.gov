How can you make your content adaptive for efficient delivery to all of these mediums?

Structured content and open content models [can help you create content](https://www.WHATEVER/2013/10/28/always-future-ready-the-benefits-of-open-content-models-and-structured-data-webinar/) that is platform-agnostic, format-free, and device-independent.

We&#8217;ve created [two open and structured content models](http://gsa.github.io/Open-And-Structured-Content-Models/index.html) that we want you to use and adapt. These content models were created to help government agencies easily publish content in multiple forms and on multiple platforms by a cross-agency working group sponsored by the General Service Administration’s [Digital Services Innovation Center](https://www.WHATEVER/about/).

The cross-agency working group created content models for &#8220;[articles](http://gsa.github.io/Open-And-Structured-Content-Models/models/article-model.html)&#8221; and &#8220;[events](http://gsa.github.io/Open-And-Structured-Content-Models/models/event-model.html)&#8220;–two commonly used content types on government websites. They define a core set of metadata elements for these two content types that may be supplemented for agency-specific use.

More importantly, you can [comment and submit pull requests](http://gsa.github.io/Open-And-Structured-Content-Models/contribute.html) to help us change these models.

**What&#8217;s Next?**

Join us Wednesday, May 14th for the first webinar in our series &#8220;[What Structured Content Can Do For You](https://www.WHATEVER/event/what-structured-content-can-do-for-you-article-model/),&#8221; which will focus on the [Article Content Model](http://gsa.github.io/Open-And-Structured-Content-Models/models/article-model.html). Members of the working group will explain:

  * what structured content is,
  * show you what structured content models can do for you,
  * walk you through the article model and show you how to use it.

In June, we’ll have a webinar that will highlight the Event Content Model.

Over the coming months, the working group plans to:

  1. Create additional content models. Give us your suggestion for the next content model on the [discussion board](https://github.com/GSA/Open-And-Structured-Content-Models/issues).
  2. Host a hands-on content model development workshop in early Fall.
  3. Produce use case studies and tools for development such as new code, metadata mapping and implementation strategies.

We want to foster a community of individuals and groups who are interested and wish to participate in this effort. To that end, the content models are now available on GitHub with a discussion platform for questions, comments, development, adaptation and implementation.

Join in the [open content modeling project](https://github.com/GSA/Open-And-Structured-Content-Models/issues) and help build a 21st century digital government!
