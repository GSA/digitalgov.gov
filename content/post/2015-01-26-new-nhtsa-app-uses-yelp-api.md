The U.S. Department of Transportation and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) [recently unveiled a new mobile app](https://www.WHATEVER/2015/01/22/saferride-app-could-save-your-life/ "SaferRide App Could Save Your Life") to help people who have been drinking get a safe ride home. The [‘SaferRide’ mobile app](http://www.nhtsa.gov/About+NHTSA/Press+Releases/2014/SaferRide-app-and-new-data-highlight-holiday-drunk-driving-crackdown), gives holiday revelers an easy way to find a ride home when they’ve had too much to drink instead of getting behind the wheel. The app encourages potential drunk drivers to stay off of the road by helping them contact a close friend, find their location, and connect directly to a taxi company to secure a safe ride. The taxicab information that the app uses will be generated by the [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/about) API so users can have the best possible experience as they head home. The app is available for [Android devices on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nhtsa.SaferRide), and [Apple devices on the iTunes store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/saferride/id950774008?mt=8).

NHTSA took the lead to negotiate a [Terms of Service](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/05/13/what-is-a-terms-of-service-and-how-do-i-get-one/ "What Is a “Terms of Service” and How Do I Get One?") (TOS) in order to use the Yelp API for the SaferRide App. GSA, Dept of State and [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/about) are now collaborating on a federal compatible TOS so all federal agencies can use Yelp in other applications that connect people to great local services.
