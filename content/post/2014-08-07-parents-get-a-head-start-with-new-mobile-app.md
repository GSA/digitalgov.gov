Head Start Resources, an app available on [iOS](http://hsicc.cmail2.com/t/j-l-idtufd-kluyyuljt-q/) and [Android](http://hsicc.cmail2.com/t/j-l-idtufd-kluyyuljt-n/), is a gateway to tools and resources for those associated with or interested in the program. With the app, users can access:

  * The latest and greatest in Head Start News and updates,
  * The nearest Head Start locations with a map feature that utilizes geolocation,
  * Links to their website via a search function, with resources pertaining to Performance Standards and information about the Head Start Act, and
  * Help by utilizing the &#8220;Contact Us&#8221; section, featuring a phone number, email, office hours, and an interactive form.

Head Start Resources has implemented numerous tools that we [mentioned last week](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/07/30/customization-is-key-to-better-mobile-user-experience/) to fit their users&#8217; needs.
