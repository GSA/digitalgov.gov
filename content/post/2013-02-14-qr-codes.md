[QR Codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_codes) or Quick Response codes are two-dimensional codes that are scanned with a smartphone, connecting individuals to additional online content or information. They are made up of modules arranged on a contrasting background.

## <a name="x-How QR Codes Work"></a>How QR Codes Work {#toc0}

To use barcode technology, a barcode reader must be enabled or downloaded on your smartphone. Each reader is a little different, but the user typically lines up the code in their viewer and activates the reader. If using a QR Code to point to a web page keep in mind the size or the QR code is directly proportional to the length of the URL it points to. This can become an issue if the generated QR code image becomes too large for use in printed materials. In that case, consider using a [URL Shortener](https://www.WHATEVER/2013/12/20/gov-url-shorteners-and-how-to-use-them/ "Gov URL Shorteners and How to Use Them").

Reader apps are available for free or for sale on commercial app store. Search the stores for QR readers.

## Uses {#toc1}

QR codes are used to bridge the offline and online world. Examples:

  * [TSA is piloting use of QR codes](http://www.tsa.gov/press/qr_codes.shtm) on airport checkpoint signs to give passengers access to additional information about screening procedures.
  * GSA&#8217;s [Federal Acquisition Service used QR codes](https://www.WHATEVER/2013/03/07/gsa-fas-qr-code/ "GSA FAS QR Code") at an expo to help attendees track booths that they visited..
  * A poster with flu information in a bus stop can have a code that can lead to a website with additional information.
  * A piece of equipment can have a QR code that can bring up a reference manual or how-to video.
  * The [Government Printing Office](http://www.gpo.gov/mobile/) and [National Park Service](http://www.nps.gov/nama/photosmultimedia/app-page.htm) (NPS) have created QR codes that allow users to download their mobile apps.
  * NPS Fort Smith National Historic Site uses QR codes on waysides to connect visitors with videos to enhance their visit to the park.

Good Practice Tip: Keep in mind that QR codes that lead to mobile-friendly content will provide the best customer experience.
