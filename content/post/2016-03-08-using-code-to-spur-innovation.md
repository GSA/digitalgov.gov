This week, President Obama will [travel to SxSW (South by Southwest)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/03/05/weekly-address-sxsw) to talk about how we can use technology to tackle tough challenges. This underscores how important data—government data, in particular—is to improving and fueling our democracy forward. 2015 saw many [open data milestones](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/02/05/open-data-empowering-americans-make-data-driven-decisions) by agencies, including:

  * [New advancements in HHS’s syndication storefront](https://www.WHATEVER/2015/12/21/with-collaboration-comes-great-things/)
  * New features to [analytics.usa.gov](https://www.WHATEVER/2015/12/01/analytics-usa-gov-new-features-and-more-data/) dashboard (now with [agency-specific dashboards](https://www.WHATEVER/2016/02/18/analytics-usa-gov-now-with-agency-specific-dashboards/))
  * [USPTO’s PatentsView](https://www.WHATEVER/2015/09/23/the-data-briefing-surrounded-by-fields-of-federal-data-u-s-patent-and-trademark-offices-patentsview/)

  * APIs from [FEC](https://www.WHATEVER/2015/07/09/introducing-the-federal-election-commissions-first-api/) , [Labor](https://www.WHATEVER/2015/07/01/safety-and-transparency-through-data/) and [NASA](https://www.WHATEVER/2015/05/27/the-api-briefing-nasa-builds-api-nasa-gov-to-launch-more-apis-to-developers/) ([to name a few](https://www.WHATEVER/tag/wednesday-api-briefing/))

There is also more to come (and more that’s needed). This month on DigitalGov we’ll take a look at what else agencies are working on, including:

  * How a [new agency addition to DAP impacts analytics.usa.gov](https://www.WHATEVER/2016/03/22/the-postal-service-just-broke-analytics-usa-gov/)
  * A look at [new datasets from NASA](https://www.WHATEVER/2016/04/01/your-trek-to-vesta-mars-starts-now/)

  * How the [CFPB’s data analysts normalize location data](https://www.WHATEVER/2016/03/11/seeing-states-the-right-way-how-to-weigh-data-by-population/) and use [tag management](https://www.WHATEVER/2016/03/31/tag-management-a-digital-analysts-best-friend/)
  * A look at the [mobile development community&#8217;s debate](https://www.WHATEVER/2016/03/09/the-data-briefing-mobile-websites-or-mobile-apps-or-both/) over mobile apps vs. mobile websites
