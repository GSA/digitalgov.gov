Memorial Day is Monday and we wanted to let you know about some mobile products available for the holiday.

  * Arlington National Cemetery&#8217;s [ANC Explorer mobile app](http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/map/ancexplorer.aspx) allows the user to locate gravesites, events, or other points of interest; generate front and back photos of a headstone or monument; and receive directions to those locations.
  * Use the National Park Service&#8217;s [National Mall app](http://www.nps.gov/nama/photosmultimedia/app-page.htm) to locate and learn more about landmarks on the National Mall, including the World War II, Korean and Vietnam War Memorials. It provides visitors with a handheld map and customizable tour plans based on the length of your visit. Using your device’s geolocation capabilities and camera, the app uses augmented reality to identify the landmarks around you.
  * If you are visiting overseas, [Pointe du Hoc](http://www.abmc.gov/multimedia?field_monument_war_tid=All&type%5B%5D=mobile_app), the mobile app from the American Battle Monuments Commission, provides the history of this World War II D-Day landing site in France. The GPS-enabled application allows you to experience the site where the U.S. Army Rangers scaled the 100 feet cliffs of Pointe du Hoc.
