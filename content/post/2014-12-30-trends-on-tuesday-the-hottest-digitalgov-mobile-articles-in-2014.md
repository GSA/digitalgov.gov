QR codes, apps about whales, bullying and railroad crossings, challenges of responsive Web design and mobilizing charts and tables were the things you were most interested in this year.

We publish [mobile trends every Tuesday](https://www.WHATEVER/tag/trends-on-tuesday/) and feature a [government mobile app every Thursday](https://www.WHATEVER/tag/thursday-mobile-products/) on the mobile channel of DigitalGov. In addition, we do recaps of MobileGov Community of Practice events and other community articles in between. This year we published 281 articles.

You were very interested in hearing about practices from others in the community. You most wanted to

  * know about [challenges around implementing Responsive Web Design](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/10/21/responsive-web-design-challenges-webinar-recap/) and
  * learning [eights ways to format mobile tables and charts](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/10/28/trends-on-tuesday-8-ways-to-format-tables-for-responsive-web-design/)
  * then [leveraging code for mobilizing tables](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/12/11/defense-finance-accounting-services-use-hhs-code-to-make-mobile-friendly-tables/) and charts.

When it came to trends, you were most interested in the

  * increasing diversity of device sizes, [popularly known as phablets](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/11/04/trends-on-tuesday-phablets-to-top-tablets-in-2015/ "Trends on Tuesday: Phablets to Top Tablets in 2015?"),
  * [meeting mobile power users](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/09/30/trends-on-tuesday-meet-the-mobile-power-users/), and
  * discussing [whether or not QR codes are still relevant](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/10/06/trends-on-tuesday-are-qr-codes-still-relevant/) (no joke!).

For mobile products, you were very interested in native apps—specifically ones that

  * help [catch child predators](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/11/13/ice-expands-reach-of-app-designed-to-locate-child-predators/),
  * [locate railroad crossings](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/01/23/rail-crossing-locator-app-from-dot/),
  * [save whales on the west coast](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/09/25/saving-the-whales-with-just-your-smartphone-west-coast-edition/) and
  * [stop bullying](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/10/09/bullying-help-prevent-and-protect-anytime-anywhere-on-any-device/) (nice people that you are!).

This data suggests agency efforts are focused on responsive Web design and you are looking at ways you can enhance your agency&#8217;s efforts (e.g., how do we mobilize tables and charts?). However, the popularity of the QR code and the changing mobile user habits articles, as well as the popularity of native apps, infers that you&#8217;re looking at ways you can leverage mobile device functionalities to bring more innovative customer experiences.

You also wanted to know [how we find out about these apps](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/10/29/open-and-api-driven-federal-mobile-app-registration/) and how you can get them on USA.gov and DigitalGov. [Sign up for our webinar](https://www.WHATEVER/event/how-to-get-your-federal-mobile-app-promoted-on-usa-gov-and-digitalgov-gov/) in January and we will show you.
