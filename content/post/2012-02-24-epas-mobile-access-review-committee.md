The <a href="http://www2.epa.gov/webguide/mobile-access-review-committee" rel="nofollow">Enivronmental Protection Agency&#8217;s Mobile Access Review Committee (MARC) </a>is a committee that evaluates external (public-facing) mobile app and mobile Web concepts prior to any development. MARC serves as point-of-contact for mobile project owners throughout the Agency and maintains mobile product requirements based on the latest technology, EPA requirements, and best practices.

## <a name="x-Why We Did It"></a>Why We Did It {#toc0}

The goal of MARC is to ensure quality and reduce redundancy in the rapidly growing field of mobile app development. The fast pace of mobile technology demands a cross-organizational body that can catalog mobile products, encourage information sharing, and streamline agency efforts in this space.

## <a name="x-What We Did"></a>What We Did {#toc1}

EPA brought together representative from the Office of External Affairs and Environmental Education (OEAEE), the Office of Environmental Information (OEI), the Office of General Counsel (OGC), the OEI Lead-Region, and one program office on a rotating basis. The Committee is charged with reviewing mobile concepts based on criteria critical to mobile app development in the public sector. All native external (public-facing) mobile app concepts must be approved by the Committee before programs may begin development. Mobile Web app and mobile website concepts have a lesser standard of review, but must also be approved by MARC prior to development.

## <a name="x-How It Works"></a>How It Works {#toc2}

EPA&#8217;s MARC has been successful in educating EPA mobile innovators about what needs to be considered when developing mobile products. EPA&#8217;s [guide on the difference between mobile apps and websites](http://www2.epa.gov/webguide/mobile-web-and-native-apps) outlines various program and technical considerations for mobile product development. The MARC evaluation process is guided by the [Mobile App Evaluation Guidance Document](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/2012/02/EPA-Mobile-App-Evaluation-Guidance-1.doc) (_MS Word, 9 pgs &#8211; 95 KB_), which provides detailed guidance for evaluating mobile app concepts based on critical criteria. The process is transparent and submitters are provided detailed explanations for the Committee&#8217;s decisions. Concepts that are not approved can be modified and resubmitted.
