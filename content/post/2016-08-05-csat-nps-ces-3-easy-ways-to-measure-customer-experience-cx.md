Have you ever wondered how to measure a [customer’s experience](https://www.WHATEVER/2015/11/20/ux-vs-cx-whats-the-dif-part-2/)? I’ve thought about it, specifically about how to measure the experience with services from government agencies. This is a complex topic because government services can be vastly different from each other. These services range from: issuing fishing and hunting permits, social security benefits, unemployment insurance, job training, business licenses, food inspection, and medical and mental health services to veterans.

Honestly, I was overwhelmed. Luckily, I got in touch with Kelly J. Ohaver, Customer Experience Manager from the [City of Centennial, Colorado](http://www.centennialco.gov/). This introductory blog spells three customer experience metrics that Kelly shared with me, along with some examples and graphs.

## Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)

Let’s start with the simplest and most well-known metric: customer satisfaction—or CSAT. It’s a measurement that looks at how well a product or service experience meets a customer’s expectation. A customer satisfaction survey can help you determine your customers&#8217; overall level of satisfaction.

For example, one of the CSAT survey questions the City of Centennial uses is, &#8220;How satisfied were you with the service you received?&#8221; Survey respondents are then asked to rate their experience on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 equals ‘Very Satisfied’ and 5 equals ‘Very Dissatisfied.’ The CSAT is expressed as a percentage; the score ranges from 1 to 100%, with 1% being the lowest level of customer satisfaction and 100% being the highest level of customer satisfaction.

## Net Promoter Score (NPS)

Net Promoter Score (NPS) is another way to measure a customer’s experience. This metric builds from the idea of word of mouth because it focuses on whether someone would recommend a service to a friend or colleague. A recommended service would indicate a positive experience, and vice versa. The metric encompasses when a customer first identified a need for a service, all service interactions, and the customer’s perception of the overall experience.

NPS is determined by a single calculation based on the question, &#8220;How likely is it that you would recommend [brand/product/service] to a friend or colleague?&#8221; (the City of Centennial tailored their question as, &#8220;How likely is it that you would recommend the service(s) provided to you by the City of Centennial to a friend or colleague?&#8221;). This will result in a score ranging from -100 to +100.

Responses are categorized as follows:

  * **Promoters** (score 9-10) are loyal enthusiasts who will keep buying and refer others, fueling growth
  * **Passives** (score 7-8) are satisfied but unenthusiastic customers who are vulnerable to competitive offerings.
  * **Detractors** (score 0-6) are unhappy customers who can damage your brand and impede growth through negative word-of-mouth.

Here’s a chart of how to calculate NPS; subtract the percent of Detractors from the percent of Promoters to determine the Net Promoter Score (_note: if you have more Detractors than Promoters, it will result in a negative score_):

## Customer Effort Score (CES)

Customer Effort Score (CES) is the last metric I found—and it’s powerful since it focuses in on one specific attribute or feature of a service. Its rationale is to look at loyalty as a way of expressing a customer’s level of satisfaction. If service providers can reduce the customer’s effort in getting a service, they’ll create customer loyalty. Ease of use fosters customer loyalty, and loyalty means [engaged customers](https://www.WHATEVER/resources/customer-experience-toolkit/) who will return. The following is an example of CES in action.

The City of Centennial uses two questions to measure and analyze CES. &#8220;To what extent do you agree with the following statement: The City of Centennial made it easy for me to handle my issue.&#8221; with a rating scale of 1 (Strongly Agree) to 5 (Strongly Disagree). And a follow up question of, &#8220;What specific technologies, business processes, and/or employee behaviors made doing business with the City easy or difficult?&#8221;

Here’s a chart to express CES; subtract the percent of those who disagree with the statement from the percent of those who agree to determine the Customer Effort Score:

My discussion with Kelly is just a foray into this topic. Clearly, there’s a lot more to learn about customer experience metrics and how government agencies use them to measure a customer’s experience. As a follow up to this blog, I’ll examine how agencies apply these metrics in real life and share my findings. Stay tuned.
