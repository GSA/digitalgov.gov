Not SATs, or BMI tests, but usability tests: connecting target customers with a government website and watching how they interact with it. Our <a href="https://www.WHATEVER/resources/user-experience-program/">DigitalGov User Experience Program</a> (formerly known as First Fridays)<a href="http://www.howto.gov/firstfridays"> </a>has taught dozens of agencies how to conduct these vital tests, and we even created a monthly group to talk about how to run these tests, and make them better.

  We call it the <a title="Web Content Managers Forum" href="https://www.WHATEVER/communities/web-managers-forum/">User Experience Community</a>, and all federal employees who are interested in usability testing are welcome to join. We have a monthly conference call where we share resources, tips and stories from our experiences. Hope to see you at the next one.
