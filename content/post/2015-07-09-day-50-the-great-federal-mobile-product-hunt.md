For those new to the hunt for #lostapps, the campaign mission is simple—find English/Spanish mobile apps and/or websites not listed on the [USA.gov Mobile Apps Directory](https://www.usa.gov/mobile-apps). The Directory is the authoritative source for federal mobile web products, and federal Agencies that do not have their apps registered here are losing out on valuable promotional opportunites on [USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/mobile-apps) and [DigitalGov](https://www.WHATEVER/tag/thursday-mobile-products/).

Here’s how you **JOIN** the Great Federal Mobile Product Hunt:

  * Go to the [Mobile Apps Directory on USA.gov](http://www.usa.gov/mobileapps.shtml) AND [GobiernoUSA.gov](http://www.usa.gov/gobiernousa/conectese-gobierno/apps.moviles.shtml) to see if your agency’s products are listed.
  * If they are listed, great! Check for updates/corrections to be added.
  * If not listed, or if there is an update&#8211;email us with the subject line “#LostApps” with the name of the mobile app or website and contact person. We will add the app or website to the registry, and we may profile it in our [Thursday Mobile Products](https://www.WHATEVER/tag/thursday-mobile-products/) series here on DigitalGov.

We will be revisiting this campaign at Day 100! We’d greatly appreciate any feedback on the Mobile Apps Directory in the meantime via email. #thehuntison
