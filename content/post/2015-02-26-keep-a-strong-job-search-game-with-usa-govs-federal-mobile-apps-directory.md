Use your smartphone to cast a wider net on your job search with help from the [USA.gov Federal Mobile Apps Directory](http://www.usa.gov/mobileapps.shtml).

Federal job hunters are no longer confined to desktop websites, so check out some of the great mobile job search apps and websites listed in the USA.gov directory. If you get hired through one of these apps, my commission is a reasonable 15 percent. (Just kidding!)

While you may be familiar with the [USAJobs mobile app](https://help.usajobs.gov/index.php/Mobile_Apps) for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iusajobs/id386297670?mt=8_) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.iusajobs.dev.android&feature=search_result#?t=W10), did you know about the [IRS jobs mobile website](http://m.jobs.irs.gov/) that runs on the USAJobs platform? The IRS mobile website allows you to both search and apply for IRS jobs.

This official app is designed to educate people interested in careers in American diplomacy, and helps the public discover what it’s all about.

And don’t forget the Department of Justice Law Jobs app, currently available for [iPhones](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/doj-law-jobs/id905071111?mt=8). Use this app to quickly find attorney jobs and legal internships within the Justice Department.
