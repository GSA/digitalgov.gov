The [social media landscape](https://www.WHATEVER/resources/negotiated-terms-of-service-agreements/ "Negotiated Terms of Service Agreements") changes every day, and viral content heralds trends to come. Government must learn to adapt in order to deliver more effective and efficient services for citizens. At this SocialGov Summit we explored the world of Viral Government and continue our efforts to bring the most advanced capabilities and strategies to agencies&#8217; missions.

Take a look at the presentation from TSA&#8217;s blogger Bob on how they [respond to viral content and make their content interesting](http://www.slideshare.net/DigitalGov/responding-to-viral-content-making-your-content-interesting "Responding to Viral Content Making Your Content Interesting") and learn how you can do the same.  Check out two of the newest social media tools and see how [HHS uses Vine](http://www.slideshare.net/DigitalGov/hhs-and-health-vine "HHS and #HealthVine") and [#HealthVine](https://blog.twitter.com/2013/introducing-datavines-how-to-tell-a-numbers-driven-story-in-six-seconds) and NASA is leveraging [Google+ Hangouts](http://www.slideshare.net/nasa/fedsocmed-gplus-hangouts "Google+ Hangouts").

Finally Jacob Parcell, Manager of Mobile Programs at GSA will teach you said social, mobile local are the three words [you need to know for Mobile Gov](https://www.WHATEVER/resources/mobile-application-development-program/ "Mobile Application Development Program").
