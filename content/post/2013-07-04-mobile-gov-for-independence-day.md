Gearing up for the Fourth? Here are some anytime, anywhere government apps that can help make celebrating the United States easier and more fun.

  * If you&#8217;re worried about the weather you can check out the [National Weather Service](http://mobile.weather.gov/#typeLocation "National Weather Service") mobile website. If the heat is a concern, the OSHA [Heat Index Safety Tool](http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/heatillness/heat_index/heat_app.html "Heat Safety Tool ") will tell you the heat index of your location and list the precautions you need to take in order to stay safe.
  * Grilling out or having a picnic? Use [Ask Karen](http://apps.usa.gov/ask-karen.shtml) from USDA to get answers to all food safety questions at anytime.
  * Are you traveling somewhere? Make sure to use [myTSA](http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/my-tsa-mobile-application) for an easier flying experience. Still in the planning stage? Check out the State Department&#8217;s [Smart Traveler](http://apps.usa.gov/smart-traveler.shtml) to help plan your itinerary and organize your trip.
  * Exploring the national capital region? The [National Park Service&#8217;s National Mall app](http://apps.usa.gov/nps-national-mall.shtml) to visit some of the most historical sites in the US.

Browse all of the free apps on the [USA.gov Apps Gallery](http://apps.usa.gov/) to find whatever might help you have a better holiday! Happy Independence Day!
