On January 16th, the [Federal Communicators Network](http://fedcommnetwork.blogspot.com/) gathered at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). The topic of the day was **Driving Employee Engagement through a Social Intranet**, and Kelly Osborn, NARA&#8217;s community manager for the Internal Collaboration Network (ICN) was the expert speaker. Kelly has been the driving force behind the project from the very beginning and gave a talk full of helpful tips, best practices, and insightful anecdotes on setting up the intranet at NARA. If you missed the presentation, we&#8217;ve compiled this TOP 10 list of moments from Kelly&#8217;s presentation.

### 10. Connect your colleagues- across the office and across the country.



### 9. Communication. Both ways.



### 8. Ok, so the name isn&#8217;t the coolest, but it&#8217;s what&#8217;s inside that counts!



### 7. Encourage people to participate in whatever way is most useful to them.



### 6. Having someone in management who believes in the project and trusts you is crucial.



### 5. Make your biggest critics into early adopters.



### 4. Encourage users to write compelling content and to involve colleagues who can contribute to a topic.



### 3. Don&#8217;t forget to consult the bell curve of early adoption.



### 2. Do everything you can to make employees feel comfortable using your social intranet.



### 1. Social intranets allow staff to connect with people they would not normally talk to- and the result is &#8220;[fasten-ating](http://blogs.archives.gov/prologue/?p=12300)&#8221; content (we promise the clip is worth the bad pun!).
