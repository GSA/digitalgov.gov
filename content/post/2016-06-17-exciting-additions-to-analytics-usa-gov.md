We’ve expanded <a href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" target="_blank">analytics.usa.gov</a> to include 15(!) more agency-specific dashboard pages. We now offer agency-specific analytics data pages for a total of 25 major federal agencies, and each one is accessible from the dropdown menu at the top of the site.

Additionally, we’ve moved the downloadable datasets to their own pages, rather than be located on the dashboard pages themselves. The page to download aggregated data for all participating sites is now <a href="https://analytics.usa.gov/data" target="_blank">analytics.usa.gov/data</a>, and each agency-specific page has a <a href="https://analytics.usa.gov/justice/data/" target="_blank">corresponding data page</a>, as well.

We’re excited to offer the public this expanded view of web analytics data, and we hope you find it useful!
