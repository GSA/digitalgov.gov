“PolicyOps” is a better way to create and implement government policies and programs through cutting-edge data analytics and new collaboration methods.

PolicyOps (“Policy” plus “Operations”) is a new proposal for improving policy making and policy implementation. Based on a cutting-edge IT management method, DevOps (“Development” plus “Operations”), PolicyOps has two major concepts. First, closer collaboration and coordination between policy designers and policy implementers. Second, a single view of the policy environment reality agreed on by the policy designers and policy implementers.

In “[PolicyOps—A Better Way to Create and Implement Government Policies and Programs](http://billbrantley.com/policyops-a-better-way-to-create-and-implement-government-policies-and-programs/)?” I describe in more detail the creation of the PolicyOps concept and how it may benefit government projects and programs.
