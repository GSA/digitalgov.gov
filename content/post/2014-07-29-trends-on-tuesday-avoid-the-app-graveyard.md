Apps that are downloaded, used a few times and then never used again, are considered part of the “app graveyard.” In fact, 95% of apps are discarded within a month of download by users, according to Smashing Magazine. By focusing on creating a great user experience, you can make sure your agency apps are used consistently and don’t end up in the app graveyard.

Smashing Magazine lists some “[Lessons Learned From the App Graveyard](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/11/28/lessons-from-an-app-graveyard/)” that government agencies should heed.

  * **Validate the Need for the App:** Before creating an app, think about your business goals and determine whether a native app is really necessary for the content/functionality you are hoping to provide to your users.
  * **Make Sure the App Works as Expected:** When apps fail to accomplish their main task, users will stop using them. To avoid this, be sure to test your app on actual mobile devices when releasing a new version or after an OS release.
  * **Don’t Drain the User’s Device:** Apps should sparingly and effectively use a device’s resources. These resources include memory space, bandwidth and battery power.
  * **Follow Design Standards and Guidelines:** Developers should ALWAYS refer to industry standards provided for all platforms (iOS, Android, or Windows), and the [MobileGov Community of Practice](https://www.WHATEVER/communities/mobile/) created [Mobile User Experience Guidelines and Recommendations](https://www.WHATEVER/resources/mobile-user-experience-guidelines-and-recommendations/) to help agencies create amazing and engaging mobile user experiences.

However, mobile development is ever changing and it is time we revisited these guidelines and recommendations. At our [Mobile Gov Workshop: Help Expand the Mobile User Experience Guidelines](https://www.WHATEVER/event/mobilegov-workshop-help-expand-the-mobile-user-experience-guidelines/) on Monday, August 4th, the MobileGov Community of Practice and the [Federal User Experience Community](https://www.WHATEVER/communities/federal-user-experience-community-of-practice/) want your thoughts on how we move those guidelines forward. [Sign up](https://www.WHATEVER/event/mobilegov-workshop-help-expand-the-mobile-user-experience-guidelines/) and help us ensure that federal mobile products don’t end up in an app graveyard!
