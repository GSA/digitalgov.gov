  Challenge and prize competitions are a new path that federal agencies take to drive innovation and solve mission-centric problems, by posing a problem or question to the public and encouraging “solvers” to respond and submit solutions. The <strong>Federal Socialgov Community</strong> is coming together this Thursday to develop better strategies that all agencies can use to support the full life-cycle of these emerging technology programs.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  The next <strong>SocialGov Summit on Prizes and Competitions</strong>, will be held at 9:30am Nov. 21 at the <strong>Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library Dream Lab</strong>.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Participants are invited to come and work hands-on to research and develop tools and resources teams need to better design, implement, market, and follow-up on their challenge programs. Lessons will include community building and retention, partnerships, communications and performance measurement. Sign up today with <strong>DigitalGov University</strong> to register and receive pre-event materials.

  On-hand will be the <a href="https://challenge.gov/" target="_blank"><strong>Challenge.gov team</strong></a>,  who helped support more than 260 federal competitions since 2010. After hosting all of those competitions, though, they learned that in order to make them successful, social media managers need to support the process, so agencies can use the power of social media to bring communities together for better solutions.

  Also, the we recently featured a post &#8220;<a title="Key to Successful Prize Competitions: Define Your Problem Statement" href="https://www.WHATEVER/2013/11/13/key-to-successful-prize-competitions-define-your-problem-statement-2/">Key to Successful Prize Competitions: Define your Problem Statement</a>,&#8221; highlighting how failing to properly define your problem up front can result in lower participation and submissions that don’t actually solve your issue.

  We hope to see you there.
