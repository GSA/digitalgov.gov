Roughly 1 in 9 (11%) websites have adopted responsive Web design, according to <a title="research" href="http://www.guypo.com/mobile/rwd-ratio-in-top-100000-websites-refined/" target="_blank">research</a> conducted by Guy Podjarny in January. While the number has risen in the last 7 months, I know you’re probably a little underwhelmed by that number. But if you are one of the agencies that have gone through the process of developing a responsive site, you are aware of the challenges that can often get in the way of progress.

[Responsive Web design](https://www.WHATEVER/tag/responsive-web-design/) isn’t a silver bullet for your agency’s mobile strategy. But when done right, it can provide users with the fast, easy experience they are seeking. Smashing Magazine suggests a <a title="few tricks" href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/07/22/responsive-web-design-should-not-be-your-only-mobile-strategy/" target="_blank">few tricks</a> that can improve your existing responsive solutions and maximize performance for users:

  * Deliver each document to all devices with the same URL and the same content, but not necessarily with the same structure.
  * When starting from scratch, follow a mobile-first approach.
  * Test what happens when resources are loaded and displayed on real devices. Don’t rely on resizing your desktop browser.
  * Use optimization tools to measure and improve performance.
  * Deliver responsive images via JavaScript until there is a better solution.
  * Load only the JavaScript you need for the current device with conditional loading.
  * Deliver above-the-fold content first.
  * Apply a smart responsive solution with one or more of these techniques: conditional loading, responsiveness according to group, and a server-side layer.
