As people become [more mobile-first and mobile-only users of the Internet](https://www.WHATEVER/2016/01/05/trends-on-tuesday-mobile-only-u-s-audiences-grow-while-broadband-usage-drops/), users opening emails on their desktop devices has dropped continuously for the past 2 years, from 22.6% to 15.3%.

The report from Yesmail states: &#8220;The results certainly support the argument for responsive design,&#8221; as those who used responsive design in all of their emails had:

  * A greater share of opens occurring on mobile devices, compared with those who never used responsive design (57.2% vs. 51.7%);
  * A notable difference in the percentage of clicks occurring on mobile devices (58% vs. 46.7%); and
  * A stronger mobile click-to-open rate (16.2% vs. 10.4%).

Making sure your email newsletters, as well as, links from your email newsletters are responsive-optimized is critical for reaching agency audiences who increasingly are [using their smartphones for most tasks](https://www.WHATEVER/2015/03/10/trends-on-tuesday-more-time-consuming-complex-tasks-on-mobile-platforms/).
