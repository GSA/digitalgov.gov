Your child can&#8217;t sleep: She has some kind of virus. You reach for a bottle of over-the-counter infant fever reducer you bought recently. _But wait_, you say to yourself: _Didn&#8217;t I hear on the news something about a recall? Which brand was that again?_

Thanks to the digital team at the **[U.S. Food & Drug Administration](http://www.fda.gov/)**, you now have access to the latest drug and food product recalls the agency oversees right at your fingertips thanks to their new [mobile-friendly FDA.gov homepage](http://blogs.fda.gov/fdavoice/index.php/2013/11/fda-takes-a-responsive-approach-to-mobile-web/).

Doctors, pharmacists, nurses and patients on-the-go can also “**Report an adverse event**” directly from the mobile homepage screen, too — and important action made much more convenient.

Looking for **specific medication or food product**? It&#8217;s easy to use the Search function, which is front and center on the page. **Consumer updates**, **news** and **FDA blogs** round out other direct-from-homepage offerings.

The FDA is the latest in the steady march of federal government agencies (EPA, State, HUD and HHS, to name a few) to use the new [responsive](https://www.WHATEVER/2013/06/11/responsive-design/ "Responsive Design Overview, Resources and Tools") design format. The FDA.gov&#8217;s homepage is the first in a series of pages the agency is equipping for responsive design, so stay tuned. Whip out your tablet or smartphone and try it out!

You can download the latest government mobile apps from the **[USA.gov Apps Gallery](http://apps.usa.gov/)**.
