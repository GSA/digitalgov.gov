Smaller doesn&#8217;t mean more popular when it comes to smartphone screen size.

According to [mobile analyst Canalys](http://www.canalys.com/newsroom/third-smart-phones-shipped-q1-had-5-plus-displays), shipments for phones with screens larger than 5&#8243; represented a third of total shipments worldwide in Q1 this year. Devices with a screen size larger than 5&#8243; are more popularly known as &#8220;phablets&#8221; (not quite tablets, not quite phones).

Government agencies have been implementing [responsive design](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/03/24/why-go-responsive-heres-what-feds-are-saying/ "Why Go Responsive? Here’s What Feds Are Saying") so their Web properties adjust to screen size. However, agencies have challenges testing for all screen sizes and operating systems and the data above demonstrate that the number of screen sizes is growing. Review your the breakpoints in your design to take the larger smartphone screens into account. The [compatibility testing](https://www.WHATEVER/2013/11/21/mobile-product-compatability-and-functional-testing-101/ "Mobile Product Compatability and Functional Testing 101") conducted by the [Federal CrowdSource Mobile Testing Program](https://www.WHATEVER/services/mobile-application-testing-program "Federal CrowdSource Mobile Testing Program") can help you ensure that your mobile user experience doesn&#8217;t break on a number of devices.
