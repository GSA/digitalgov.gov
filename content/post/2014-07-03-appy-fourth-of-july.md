Washington.

You can say a lot of things about this town, but one thing is clear: Fourth of July is our holiday.

No one rocks Independence Day quite like we do, thanks to the hardworking people at the [National Park Service](http://www.nps.gov/index.htm) who manage our National Mall and help stage [a blockbuster fireworks celebration](http://www.nps.gov/foju/fireworks.htm) there that rivals any around the globe.

Coming to &#8220;America&#8217;s front yard&#8221; for the festivities? The NPS [National Mall app](http://www.nps.gov/nama/photosmultimedia/app-page.htm) is a must-download. It offers on-the-go access to sightseeing information, maps, and customizable self-guided tours for iOS and Android users that uses your phone&#8217;s geolocation feature to identify all the cool landmarks and monuments along the Mall.

If you&#8217;re in town for a few days, you really should try tour of one of the most recognizable buildings in the world: The U.S. Capitol. This April, the [Architect of the Capitol](http://www.visitthecapitol.gov/) [launched a Capitol Visitor Center app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/u.s.-capitol-visitor-guide/id796994687?mt=8) to give mobile users everything they need to know about booking the free tour, what you&#8217;ll be seeing (the Dome alone will stun the pants off you), and most important, how to get through security without ending up as CNN Breaking News. Plus: Be sure to download the companion mobile guide for the [spectacular National Statuary Hall](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/guide-to-national-statuary/id740679439) that tells the stories behind the statues that represent each state.

If you find the idea of spending the Fourth shoulder-to-shoulder with hundreds of thousands of other people repelling, you can still enjoy the [national fireworks on television](http://www.pbs.org/a-capitol-fourth/home/) from the air-conditioned environs of your own home. While you&#8217;re all comfy in front of the TV (we know you&#8217;ll have your [smartphone or tablet next to you](https://www.WHATEVER/2013/07/16/trends-on-tuesday-mobile-a-second-screen-for-tv-viewing/ "Trends on Tuesday: Mobile a “Second Screen” for TV Viewing"), so don&#8217;t even try to deny it), check out the [National Archives](http://www.archives.gov/)&#8216; [Today&#8217;s Document mobile app](http://www.archives.gov/social-media/todays-doc-app.html) to learn what happened, through historic documents and photographs, on any day in history. I&#8217;m pretty sure you&#8217;ll find something pretty special happened 238 years ago this Friday &#8230;
