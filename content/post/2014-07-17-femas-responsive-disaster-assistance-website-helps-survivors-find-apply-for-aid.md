Hurricane Arthur, the first named storm of the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season, made landfall in North Carolina, July 3, as a Category 2 hurricane. It was no Sandy, but Arthur nevertheless reminds us to be prepared now and always.

As we say at [NOAA](http://www.noaa.gov), &#8220;It only takes one.&#8221;

That &#8220;one&#8221; could be a hurricane or wildfire or any disaster or extreme event. If after a disaster you find yourself with only a mobile device in hand as your most convenient or sole Internet access point, a redesigned FEMA website might come as a small bit of relief.

**[DisasterAssistance.gov](http://www.disasterassistance.gov/)** has recently been refashioned in [responsive design](https://www.WHATEVER/2013/06/11/responsive-design/ "Responsive Design Overview, Resources and Tools") that provides mobile and non-mobile users of all devices, computer types and screen sizes a similar Web experience and easy access to what disaster survivors need, when they need it. At DisasterAssistance.gov you can:

  * **Access** FEMA&#8217;s Disaster Survivor Application Checklist;

  * **Find** disaster assistance that meets your personal needs, including more than 70 forms of assistance from 17 federal agencies;

  * **Apply** for disaster assistance; and

  * **Check** the status of your application for assistance, straight from your screen.

It&#8217;s also a good time to remind you about a perfect companion to this site: the [Disaster Reporter feature of FEMA&#8217;s app](http://www.fema.gov/disaster-reporter), which [we blogged about](https://www.WHATEVER/2014/01/16/fema-app-adds-disaster-reporter-feature/) in January. The app feature, now available for both Android and iOS, enables anyone to submit geographically tagged and captioned photos taken during and after a disaster. FEMA will then plot approved images on an interactive map. Disaster Reporter is part of the agency&#8217;s effort to use **citizen intelligence** to better understand and respond to all kinds of disasters and extreme events.

Don&#8217;t wait until mayhem finds its way to your doorstep to become acquainted with these and other tools.
