The Central Intelligence Agency launched their Twitter account with [the second most retweeted inaugural post](https://twitter.com/CIA/status/474971393852182528) in the platform’s history: “_We can neither confirm nor deny that this is our first tweet_.”

Now for the first time, on the DigitalGov podcast, learn from the CIA itself the best practices behind one of the most high-profile social media accounts in both the public and private sector.

Justin Herman, GSA lead for the government-wide [SocialGov Community](https://www.WHATEVER/communities/social-media/), explores the story-behind-the-stories with Carolyn Reams, web strategist for [CIA.gov](https://www.cia.gov/index.html), on not-so-secret subjects including:

  * How and why did the CIA get into social media?
  * What does a great day look like for the CIA social media team?
  * How has the high profile of their accounts and overwhelming response changed internal stakeholder expectations?
  * Behind the scenes accounts of well-known CIA social media engagements, including: “The Dr. Zhivago Incident” and “The #Sharkweek Case of Julia Child and the Shark Repellent.”
  * What’s next?

Also joining the conversation is Scott Horvath, social media lead for the U.S. Geological Survey, providing perspectives from his more than eight years of experience in government social media.<audio class="wp-audio-shortcode" id="audio-302122-4" preload="none" style="width: 100%;" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/2015/08/CIA\_Podcast.mp3?\_=4" />
