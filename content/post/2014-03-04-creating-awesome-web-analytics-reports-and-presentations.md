Collecting visitor, engagement, and traffic data for your digital channels is nothing new. By this time, you have a lot of data about your website. How do you use and present that data to make meaningful recommendations? How do you use the data to tell a story and grab your stakeholders’ attention?

Sarah Kaczmarek, from GAO, has worked with GSA on a series of webinars to answer these questions. She also created a Google Analytics for government [training manual](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/2014/05/2ND_EDITION__GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_FOR_GOVERNMENT_TRAINING_MANUAL-4.pdf), and templates for reporting your metrics on a [weekly](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/2014/03/google-analytics-sample-weekly-report.docx), [quarterly](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/2014/03/google-analytics-sample-quarterly-report.docx), and [annual](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sitesusa/wp-content/uploads/sites/212/2014/03/google-analytics-template.pdf) basis. Now these resources are all together in one blog post for you.
