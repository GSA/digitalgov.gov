_[Guidance for Contributing Digital Content to FDsys](https://www.fdlp.gov/file-repository/outreach/events/depository-library-council-dlc-meetings/2016-meeting-proceedings/2016-dlc-meeting-and-fdl-conference/2813-guidance-for-contributing-digital-content-to-fdsys-govinfo) (govinfo) is now available on [FDLP.gov](https://www.fdlp.gov)._ 

[Federal Information Preservation Network](https://www.fdlp.gov/project-list/federal-information-preservation-network) (FIPNet) digital imaging partners now have guidance documentation for creating and contributing digitally-imaged U.S. Government content to [Federal Digital System](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/) (FDsys)/[**govinfo**](https://www.govinfo.gov/features/news/meet-govinfo)*. The guidance specifications are based on current best practices from the Federal Agency Digitization Guidelines Initiative and the Association for Library Collections and Technical Services “Minimum Digitization Capture Recommendations.”

The Guidance document is provided to encourage libraries and other stakeholders to contribute digitally-imaged Federal publications to FDsys (**govinfo**) to increase access to legacy and historic U.S. Government information and to preserve digital U.S. Government publications in GPO’s trustworthy digital repository, FDsys (**govinfo**).

**The Partner Guidance Document:**

  * Provides digital imaging best practices and methods for FIPNet partners preparing publications to be digitally-imaged
  * Prescribes preferred and acceptable specifications for digital imaging, including file formats, bit depth, and resolution
  * Describes preferred and acceptable specifications for Technical and Bibliographic metadata to accompany imaging files

If you are planning a digital imaging project, would like to contribute content to FDsys (**govinfo**), or just have questions about this guidance document, please [contact us by email](mailto:PreserveFedInfo@gpo.gov).

&nbsp;

_***govinfo** is GPO’s beta website that will eventually replace the FDsys website. The availability of this new website has no impact on the content, metadata, preservation repository, application of digital signatures, or any other back end processing of the content. This means all content available through this site is the same content you would get through the FDsys website. Simply put, **govinfo** is the new front door to accessing the same content and it is available at [www.govinfo.gov](https://www.govinfo.gov)._

_GPO plans to offer **govinfo** tutorials and webinars when the site is closer to being out of the beta stage. Until then, you can access available recorded webinars through the [FDLP Academy](http://login.icohere.com/public/topics.cfm?cseq=1172). For more information, see [Meet govinfo](https://www.govinfo.gov/features/news/meet-govinfo)._
