But swimming the healthy and safe way? Well, everyone could use help on that.

Whether you are a swimmer, lifeguard, pool attendant or sun-loving spectator, the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/)&#8216;s [Healthy Swimming iPhone/iPad app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/healthy-swimming/id649091713) is for you. With a simple click or two, find the most accurate information about:

  * Where we swim: Pool or ocean? Lake or river? (A fun infographic reminds you why you shouldn&#8217;t drink any of the recycled water from splash fountains and spray parks.)
  * What&#8217;s in the water? (Oh boy. You&#8217;ll want to find out how to check the water quality of your favorite lake or beach.)
  * Tips on how to stay healthy and safe in a variety of swimming scenarios and weather conditions, including during excessive heat.
  * The benefits of swimming. (the obvious and not-so-obvious)

**What lurks beneath&#8230;

But have lingering memories of &#8220;Jaws&#8221; and &#8220;Sharknado&#8221; made you timid about taking a dip in the ocean? Shark attacks on humans are rare, regardless of the sensational headlines or great entertainment they make. You may be more likely to encounter a shark at the end of your fishing rod! In the Atlantic, you might just haul in a shortfin mako. Help conserve these majestic creatures by releasing it back to the ocean and documenting its location—straight from the boat. [NOAA Fisheries Service shark experts](http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/stories/a/species/sharks/index.html) created the [Release Mako smartphone app](http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/sfa/hms/shortfinmako/mako_app.html) to help you do that (it&#8217;s available on iOS and Android—see our [blog post](https://www.WHATEVER/2013/11/14/noaa-release-mako-now-on-ios/)). Join other conservation-minded anglers in this cause and see the results on an interactive map.
