One year ago today, President Obama signed an [executive order](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-) that made open and machine-readable data the new default for government information. This [historic step](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/obama-administration-releases-historic-open-data-rules-enhance-governmen) is helping to make government-held data more accessible to the public and to entrepreneurs while appropriately safeguarding sensitive information and rigorously protecting privacy.

Freely available data from the U.S. government is an important national resource, serving as fuel for entrepreneurship, innovation, scientific discovery, and [economic growth](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/04/08/impact-open-data). Making information about government operations more readily available and useful is also core to the promise of a more efficient and transparent government. This initiative is a key component of the President’s Management Agenda and our efforts to ensure the government is acting as an engine to expand economic growth and opportunity for all Americans. The Administration is committed to driving further progress in this area, including by designating Open Data as one of our key Cross-Agency Priority Goals.

Over the past few years, the Administration has launched a number of Open Data Initiatives aimed at scaling up open data efforts across the [Health](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/2013opendata.pdf), [Energy](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/2013opendata.pdf), [Climate](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/2013opendata.pdf), [Education](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/2013opendata.pdf), [Finance](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/2013opendata.pdf), [Public Safety](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/2013opendata.pdf), and [Global Development](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/2013opendata.pdf) sectors. The White House has also launched [Project Open Data](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/05/16/introducing-project-open-data), designed to share best practices, examples, and software code to assist federal agencies with opening data. These efforts have helped unlock troves of valuable data—that taxpayers have already paid for—and are making these resources more open and accessible to innovators and the public.

Other countries are also opening up their data. In June 2013, President Obama and other G7 leaders endorsed the [Open Data Charter](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-data-charter), in which the United States committed to publish a roadmap for our nation’s approach to releasing and improving government data for the public.

Building upon the Administration’s [Open Data progress](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/12/09/open-data-round), and in fulfillment of the Open Data Charter, today we are excited to release the [U.S. Open Data Action Plan](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/us_open_data_action_plan.pdf). The plan includes a number of exciting enhancements and new data releases planned in 2014 and 2015, including:

  * **Small Business Data**: The Small Business Administration’s (SBA) database of small business suppliers will be enhanced so that software developers can create tools to help manufacturers more easily find qualified U.S. suppliers, ultimately reducing the transaction costs to source products and manufacture domestically.
  * **Smithsonian American Art Museum Collection**: The Smithsonian American Art Museum’s entire digitized collection will be opened to software developers to make educational apps and tools. Today, even museum curators do not have easily accessible information about their art collections. This information will soon be available to everyone.
  * **FDA Adverse Drug Event Data**: Each year, healthcare professionals and consumers submit millions of individual reports on drug safety to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These anonymous reports are a critical tool to support drug safety surveillance. Today, this data is only available through limited quarterly reports. But the Administration will soon be making these reports available in their entirety so that software developers can build tools to help pull potentially dangerous drugs off shelves faster than ever before.

We look forward to implementing the U.S. Open Data Action Plan, and to continuing to work with our partner countries in the G7 to take the open data movement global.
