Instagram is a free online <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_sharing" target="_blank">photo-sharing</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_hosting_service" target="_blank">video-sharing</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking_service" target="_blank">social networking</a> service that allows its users to take pictures and videos, apply digital <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_filter" target="_blank">filters</a> to them, and share them on a variety of social networking services, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblr" target="_blank">Tumblr</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flickr" target="_blank">Flickr</a>. It’s one of the fastest growing digital services, with over 130 million users.

Instagram can be used by federal agencies as part of an overall social and mobile strategy to ensure citizens can access valuable government content anywhere, anytime, on any device&#8211;including widespread access to photos and video content. As one example, the **White House** just <a href="http://instagram.com/whitehouse" target="_blank">launched an account on Instagram</a> to share images of the President’s diplomatic trip to Africa, attracting nearly 100,000 initial followers.

Instagram is now listed on **HowTo.gov** among the more than 60 other <a href="https://www.WHATEVER/resources/negotiated-terms-of-service-agreements/" target="_blank">tools and apps with federal-friendly terms of service</a>, and will be added to the <a href="https://www.WHATEVER/services/social-media-registry/" target="_blank">Federal Social Media Registry</a>.
