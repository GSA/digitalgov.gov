Around the D.C. area, one of the first signs of spring are the numerous farmers markets. In my neighborhood alone, I regularly visit four farmers markets that have a wide variety of produce and baked goods. Farmers markets are good for the local economy, and the easy access to fresh fruits and vegetables helps local communities.

Realizing the importance of farmers markets, the USDA released the [Farmers Market Directory API](http://blogs.usda.gov/2013/05/15/new-api-helps-satisfy-the-nations-app-etite-for-farmers-markets/) so that developers can create apps to help people find farmers markets in their area. The [Market Mapper](http://mvjantzen.com/tools/markets.html) is a great example of combining Google Maps and the Farmers Market Directory API. I just typed in my zip code and found several new markets with information on products, when the market is open, and travel directions.

Farmers markets are as old as civilization itself and have played a major role in history. However, even this age-old innovation can benefit from the power of APIs.

_Each week in &#8220;The API Briefing,&#8221; I will showcase government APIs and the latest API news and trends. Visit this blog every week to learn how government APIs are transforming government and improving government services for the American people.
