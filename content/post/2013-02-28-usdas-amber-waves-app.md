The [U.S. Department of Agriculture&#8217;s (USDA) Economic Research Service (ERS)](http://www.ers.usda.gov/) has developed a tablet app for their _Amber Waves_ magazine which showcases research and analysis on economic and policy issues related to agriculture, food, the environment, and rural America. Available as a [free download](http://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves) for both Android tablets and Apple&#8217;s iPad, the magazine will be updated quarterly on the app.

Each issue of _Amber Waves_ provides:

  * Informative articles—indepth Features and brief Findings
  * Engaging infographics and timely data
  * Indicators illustrating the state of the American food and fiber sector, along with U.S. farm, rural, and natural resources

Amber Waves is one of a number of epublications and other mobile products you can find on the [USA.gov&#8217;s Apps Gallery](http://apps.usa.gov/).
