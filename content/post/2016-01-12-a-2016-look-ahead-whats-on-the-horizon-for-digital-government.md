With January, and the tearing off of the old calendar, comes the annual taking stock of [where we&#8217;ve been in the last year](https://www.WHATEVER/2015/12/31/digitalgovs-2015-year-in-review/) and where we can go in the year ahead.

So for this month&#8217;s editorial theme, we&#8217;re taking a closer look at what we think 2016 will bring for digital government—from mobile and content, to open data and accessibility. If our &#8220;prognosticators&#8221; are correct, this year will be the year when [apps become more Web-like](https://www.WHATEVER/2016/01/12/trends-on-tuesday-10-mobile-government-and-tech-trends-for-2016/); [video could overtake social media](https://www.WHATEVER/2016/01/11/the-content-corner-content-trends-for-2016/) as the preferred method to communicate; and the number of sensors providing real-time access to (government) data will dramatically increase&#8230;just to name a few.

Check back throughout this month to see what&#8217;s on the horizon this year.
