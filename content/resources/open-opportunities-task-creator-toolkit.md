## Preparation

1. **Brainstorm and Review:**
   + [10 Tips for Creating the Perfect Task](https://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/open-opportunities-task-creator-toolkit/10-tips-for-creating-the-perfect-open-opportunity-task/)
2. **Add Tasks to Open Opps**
   + Go to the Open Opps website: [openopps.usajobs.gov](https://openopps.usajobs.gov "Open Opps website")
   + Click "Opportunities" in the upper right hand corner of the screen. If on a mobile device, first click the menu icon, then "Opportunities."
3. **_Note:_** <br />
Task is reviewed by Open Opps staff.
4. **_Note:_** <br />
You will receive an email when your task is approved and goes live. (You will also be emailed if edits are needed.)

{{< legacy-img src="/2015/04/215-x-215-open-opps-email-share-button.jpg" alt="215-x-215-open-opps-email-share-button" >}}

1. **Market Your Task**
   + Advertise to relevant communities of practice using our [marketing template](https://s3.amazonaws.com/digitalgov/_legacy-img/2015/04/Open-Opps-Marketing-Email-Template-for-CoPs.docx) (1 page, 14 kb, MS Word, .docx).
   + Use the "share" button on the right of the task page to send a form email.
2. **_Note:_** <br />
You will receive an automatic email notification when participants indicate that they want to do your task.
3. **Review Participants** <br />
Task Creators need to respond to interested participants within **24 hours**. (You don't need to assign the task that quickly, but some acknowledgement should occur within that time frame.)
4. **Remove Extra Participants** <br />
Remove any extra participants from the task. **It is your responsibility to email extra participants prior to assigning the task.** Please review our [template](https://s3.amazonaws.com/digitalgov/_legacy-img/2015/04/Open-Opps-Opportunity-Assigned-to-Someone-Else-Email-Template.docx) (1 page, 15 kb, MS Word .docx) for a suggested message.

## Wrapping Up

{{< legacy-img src="/2015/04/215-x-233-open-opps-change-state.jpg" alt="Screen capture of the Change Opportunity State link" >}}

1. **Assign Task** <br />
When you are ready to select participants, change the opportunity state to "assigned." (Box is on the right side of the task page when you are logged in).
2. **_Note:_** <br />
Automatic email sent to participants, signifying their selection. You will be CC'd. **Be sure you removed extra participants** or they will also receive the "you've been assigned" email!
3. **Task Editing**
   + Make edits if the task changes after posting.
   + If you are going to be out of the office, choose a colleague to be a replacement task creator (you can switch task creators anytime) or put your open task back into draft via the opportunity state box.
4. **Task Archiving**
   + If your task is not picked up within a needed time frame, change the opportunity state to "archived."
   + For example, if your task needs to be done by March 3rd, and nobody selects it, change the status to "archived" on March 4th.
5. **Closing Tasks** <br />
If your task has been completed, change the opportunity state to "completed."
