## What is a podcast?

A podcast is similar to a radio talk show, except it is online and pre-recorded. Because podcasts can be downloaded, users can listen to them anywhere and at any time, making them uniquely accessible to a busy audience on the go.

## Why use the podcast format?

[Podcasts](https://digital.gov/topics/podcast/) are known for their more personal, conversational quality. They can be a great way for federal agencies to connect with the public, address their questions, promote trust, and increase transparency. Podcasts can also be an effective medium to provide vital insight and updates about government work, projects, and upcoming initiatives.

But they may not be right in every context, and they’re a lot of work to create and maintain. Before using this format, be sure to ask yourself: why do I need a podcast?

## How do I start podcasting?

If you decide that podcasts are right for your agency and you have buy-in from leadership, here are four steps to get you started.

### Step 1. Map out your vision and resources

#### Create a launch plan

Consider foundational elements such as:
- Provide a clear vision for your podcast and where you see it going.
- Establish achievable performance goals within a specific timeframe.
- Define your target audiences and consider how your podcast will reach them.
- Prepare a list of ways in which your podcast meets your agency’s business objectives.
- Define the key messages you’re hoping listeners will take away from your podcast.
- Detail the roles and responsibilities of team members who will work on the podcast.

#### Identify your theme

Your podcast theme determines the topics you will cover, the topics you will not cover, and how the show might be structured. Try to identify a theme that is broad enough to be flexible, but not so broad that your audience has no idea what you will be discussing.

#### Understand your resources

Find out if your agency has dedicated personnel and a budget for communications or podcasting. From there, you can decide who will be involved and to what degree you can reasonably expect them to work on podcasting.

### Step 2. Establish the structure of your podcast
Once you have a clear understanding of your goals, target audience, and resources, your podcast will begin to take shape. As you determine the structure of your podcast, keep your listeners in mind. Consider how you can create a consistent and engaging experience through every episode you release.

#### Establish a cadence

Creating and maintaining a podcast requires an investment of time and effort. Consider the following to choose what sort of cadence works best for your agency:

- What information do you have to share at regular intervals?
- How many people are available to be dedicated to this effort?
- How long will your pre- and post-production tasks (like scripting, editing, and transcription) take?
- How long do approvals in your agency usually take?

Think of your availability and all the moving parts involved. If you take on too much, your podcast might become a burden instead of a valuable communications tool.

#### Choose a podcast format

The format of your podcast determines how your show is structured and presented. Two stand out as common “go-tos” formats:

- **Narrative:** As a narrator, you tell a story — often interspersed with snippets from interviews with subject matter experts.
- **Interview:** As an interviewer, you lead a question-and-answer style discussion with one or more guests.

Every episode doesn’t have to follow the same format, but you do want to give your audience a sense of what to expect.

#### Determine episode length

As you consider episode length, think about sustainability. Remember: longer episodes may require more time for production, editing, research, and other tasks. While each episode does not have to be the same length, consistency helps your listeners know what to expect and encourages you to be realistic about your production capacity.

### Step 3. Build a content creation workflow

#### Start with accessibility

It’s important to create [accessible media content](https://www.section508.gov/create/synchronized-media/) that can be enjoyed by your listeners. For example, consider whether you will provide episodes through a pre-written script or using transcription software. Establish a plan to check your transcripts for accuracy and post them in an accessible format.

#### Be aware of copyright

Check the [copyright](https://copyright.gov/what-is-copyright/) and terms of use for any image, art, or music for your podcast. Be sure you have permissions for all types of media you plan to incorporate.

#### Choose your distribution platform

Not all podcast platforms are federal-friendly in terms of [accessibility](https://digital.gov/topics/accessibility/), [security](https://digital.gov/topics/security/), and other considerations. Before selecting a platform, you’ll need to do your research. Talk with your IT and contracting office colleagues to find out what software or applications are approved for use at your agency.

#### Pick your recording technology

Some people have state-of-the-art microphones and advanced editing software, while others use their phones or a common conference platform. Podcasts can be as elaborate or as basic as you want. The important thing is to understand how your technology works, and to be sure that the technology meets your users’ needs.  

### Step 4. Evaluate your performance

#### Promote your podcast

The work isn’t done after you release your first episode. Create and use a promotion strategy to make sure your podcast reaches the target audiences you identified in your launch plan. Use any existing platforms available to you, like social media pages or RSS feeds.

#### Track engagement for success metrics

Use [analytics](https://digital.gov/topics/analytics/) to understand how your podcast is performing and if it is reaching your intended audience. Return to your launch plan and identify metrics that can measure your performance goals. These could include the number of podcast downloads or streams, or demographic information on where listeners are finding your podcast. Pay attention to what the quantitative data and qualitative audience feedback are telling you, and make changes as necessary.

{{< ring title="Case study: GSA Does That!?">}}

The U.S. General Services Administration’s “GSA Does That!?” podcast offers an inside look at how GSA and its partners provide value and impact for the public. It features in-depth interviews with GSA leaders and experts, as well as others who can offer a fresh perspective to listeners.

By the end of its first season in 2023, [the podcast had an aggregate of over 6,000 listeners and ranked in the top 10% of government-produced podcasts](https://www.gsa.gov/blog/2024/02/28/gsa-podcast-launches-second-season-with-conversation-on-jobs-and-sustainability). Executive producer Max Stempora offers three important pieces of advice from the podcast:

- Know your audience and the story you want to tell.
- Remain flexible and embrace change in methodology and planning approaches
- Focus on feedback from leadership and listeners instead of getting too bogged down in the metrics.
