If your app doesn&#8217;t have a good user experience, it goes to the [app graveyard]({{< ref "2014-07-29-trends-on-tuesday-avoid-the-app-graveyard.md" >}}).

The need for digital products to work better is not new in the federal government. Resources like the [Digital Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/) and [Public Participation Playbook](https://participation.usa.gov/) have had impact helping agencies become user-friendly and both of these resources note the importance of developing usable products for mobile users.

As more agencies develop mobile apps and websites, they need quick guidance on mobile user experience Do&#8217;s and Don&#8217;ts. To answer their call, we asked [MobileGov Community of Practice]({{< ref "/communities" >}}) members to choose their top Mobile UX Guidelines from the original group of 42 created in 2013 at community events in late 2014 and early 2015. From that feedback, we have distilled the following six mobile user experience guidelines:

**[Guideline 1](#guideline1 "Mobile User Experience Guidelines and Recommendations 1")**: Make sure your content is structured and chunked appropriately for multiple devices

**[Guideline 2](#guideline2 "Mobile User Experience Guidelines and Recommendations 2")**: Follow industry user interface guidelines and government regulations (like 508) in the development of your mobile product

**[Guideline 3](#guideline3 "Mobile User Experience Guidelines and Recommendations 3")**: Leverage the device’s features for usability and accessibility

**[Guideline 4](#guideline4 "Mobile User Experience Guidelines and Recommendations 4")**: Test at multiple points in the design/development process

**[Guideline 5](#guideline5 "Mobile User Experience Guidelines and Recommendations 5")**: Collect and use data (quantitative and qualitative) to determine what content your users want and where

**[Guideline 6](#guideline6 "Mobile User Experience Guidelines and Recommendations 6")**: Develop security and privacy guidelines with regard to what the app does/how it protects user data and government systems

Below we have added specific resources to each guideline.
