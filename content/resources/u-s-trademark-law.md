United States trademark law is mainly governed by the Lanham Act. &#8220;Common law&#8221; trademark rights are acquired automatically when a business uses a name or logo in commerce, and are enforceable in state courts. Marks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office are given a higher degree of protection in federal courts than unregistered marksâ€”both registered and unregistered trademarks are granted some degree of federal protection under the Lanham Act 43(a).
