## What are pronouns?

In grammar, pronouns are the words we use to refer to ourselves or other people: I, you, we, etc. In some cases, these pronouns can refer to a person’s gender: he, her, them, etc. Just like someone’s name, these pronouns are personal and important to us because they are part of our identity. They are also the words we use to connect with and call on each other:

* Do **they** need help?
* **I** love **you**!
* **She** is **his** legal guardian.

At GSA, we often share our [pronouns](https://pronouns.org/) to include and respect the diverse identities of our colleagues.

You might have seen someone sign an email with a set of pronouns in parentheses, for example:

* Nadine Jung (she/her)
* Mack Smith (they/him)
* Jesse Nez (they/them)
* Maria Ruiz (she/her/ella)

When someone shares their pronouns to sign their name, in their email signature block, or to introduce themselves, they are letting you know the pronouns that you should use when referring to them, whether you are in their presence, referring to them in a document, or speaking about them with someone else. Some people who speak multiple languages may indicate this by providing their pronouns in both English and another language&mdash;for example, *él* and *ella* are the Spanish pronouns for *he* and *her*, respectively.

## Why is it important to use someone’s pronouns?

From a federal perspective, it is a Biden Administration priority to advance [equity and inclusion in the federal workforce](https://whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/06/25/executive-order-on-diversity-equity-inclusion-and-accessibility-in-the-federal-workforce/) for individuals who belong to communities that face discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, gender non-conforming, and non-binary (LGBTQI+) persons. The White House plans to:

Using someone’s pronouns is simply a respectful choice that contributes to a healthy and inclusive work environment. It’s also a priority of the federal government.

## How to incorporate pronouns in your digital environment

Now that [more people are working from home](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2022/people-working-from-home.html), there are more opportunities for people in the federal workforce to display their names.

{{< do-dont-table caption="When participating in the community, community members must follow the ground rules for discussions." >}}
  {{< row >}}
    {{< do-row >}} Share your pronouns. Even if you are not in the LGBTQI+ community, you can choose to share your pronouns when introducing yourself to a new person, when speaking on a group call, etc. This helps normalize the act of sharing pronouns in all settings and prevent “outing” transgender or gender nonconforming people. (Outing someone is when their identity is exposed without their consent.) {{< /do-row >}}
    {{< dont-row >}} Don’t take offense if someone shares their pronouns or asks about your pronouns. {{< /dont-row >}}
  {{< /row >}}

  {{< row >}}
    {{< do-row >}} Add your own pronouns, if you’re comfortable sharing them, in your email signature or other places your name is displayed. {{< /do-row >}}

  {{< /row >}}

  {{< row >}}
    {{< do-row >}} Make a real effort to use someone’s pronouns, and encourage others to do the same. {{< /do-row >}}

  {{< /row >}}

  {{< row >}}
