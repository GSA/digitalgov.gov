Customer Experience (CX) is defined as the sum of all experiences a customer has with your organization. Since government is often a sole-source service provider (e.g., there’s only one place to pay taxes, or get a driver’s license), CX is even more important in the public sector than in other organizations. If that’s not enough to convince you, view this [webinar on why federal agencies must improve CX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFJg-8KwR9I).

This Toolkit is intended to help government agencies improve how we deliver services and information to the public.

How to use this guide:

* Honestly assess where you’re doing well, and where you need some work, then use the resources below to help you improve
* Coordinate internally, to ensure your agency “speaks with one voice” across the entire organization
* Start small and iterate—focus on changes that will have a positive impact on the largest customer groups first

Topics covered in this toolkit include: [Strategy](#strategy "Strategy"), [Governance](#governance "Governance"), [Culture](#culture "Culture"), [Customer Understanding](#customer-understanding "Customer Understanding"), [Design](#design "Design"), [Measurement](#measurement "Measurement"), [Digital Services](#digital-services "Digital Services"), and [Collaboration](#collaboration "Collaboration").

## Strategy

Make the customer experience a strategic priority for your entire organization.
