The bilingual glossaries, dictionaries, and Spanish language style guides available in this section are resources for government employees, translators, and communications professionals who work with the government to improve the way we communicate with the public in languages other than English.

**Glossaries**
We gathered existing bilingual glossaries from around the government and put them in one central location for easy access. The glossaries are organized by topic, some offer a variety of languages, and come from different government agencies in the federal, state, or local governments or organizations commissioned by the government to produce them.

**Dictionaries**
The Bilingual Dictionary from the National Cancer Institute is a collection of over 8,300 cancer terms in English and Spanish to provide a comprehensive cancer vocabulary that can be easily used with a variety of audiences when communicating complex information.

**Multilingual Language Style Guides**
The Multilingual Language Style Guides contain information on grammar and style issues to standardize the use of languages across government. Also includes style guides from other government entities.
