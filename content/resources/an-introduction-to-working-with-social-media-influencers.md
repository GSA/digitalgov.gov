## What is an influencer program?

In the rapidly evolving social media landscape, working with influencers has become a popular way to reach a desired audience. A social media influencer is anyone with a social media following beyond their personal friends and family who has the ability to impact others’ decisions with their digital content.

## Why partner with social media influencers?

While working with influential people is an established communications tactic (e.g., featuring celebrities in public service announcements), the rise of social media has made working with social media influencers an effective communications tool, especially in commercial marketing. However, government agencies are recognizing the potential for social media influencers to achieve non-commercial sales goals, such as public health information. For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) Center for Tobacco Products works with influencers on their public health education campaigns to prevent and reduce tobacco use. 

## How to design, implement, and measure an influencer program

After nine years of experience implementing influencer programs, experts in influencer marketing from FDA and its contractors, Rescue Agency and FCB New York, wrote and published [Influencers 101: Best Practices and Practical Approaches for Public Health Campaigns](https://digitalmedia.hhs.gov/tobacco/print_materials/CTP-237?locale=en). This guide, which won a Gold Digital Health Award in 2023, covers important aspects of influencer programs and answers common questions, such as:
- What are some examples of influencer program goals?
- How can I get buy-in from my organization’s leadership to work with influencers?
- What types of content can influencers create for my organization?
- How can I mitigate risk in my influencer program?
- What are some ways to measure the success of an influencer program?

Influencer programs can require extensive planning, but this resource will make it easier to design, implement, and measure an influencer program to achieve your program’s goals.
