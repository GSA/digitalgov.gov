## What is an influencer program?

In the rapidly evolving social media landscape, working with influencers has become a popular way to reach a desired audience. A social media influencer is anyone with a social media following beyond their personal friends and family who has the ability to impact others’ decisions with their digital content.

## Why partner with social media influencers?

Working with influential people is an established communications tactic and public service announcements have featured celebrities for many years.

More recently, the rise of social media has made working with social media influencers an effective communications tool, especially in commercial marketing. Government agencies are also recognizing the potential for social media influencers to achieve non-commercial sales goals, such as public health information.

For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) [Center for Tobacco Products](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-organization/center-tobacco-products) works with influencers on their public health education campaigns to prevent and reduce tobacco use.

## How to design, implement, and measure an influencer program

The FDA published [Influencers 101: Best Practices and Practical Approaches for Public Health Campaigns](https://digitalmedia.hhs.gov/tobacco/print_materials/CTP-237).
