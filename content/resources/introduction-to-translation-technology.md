## Key takeaway

**Agencies should work with competent human translators for all translations**, including translations supported by translation technology.

## Why create multilingual content?

All people in this country, regardless of the language they speak, deserve meaningful access to programs and activities that are conducted or supported by federal agencies.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, nearly [68 million people spoke a language other than English](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/12/languages-we-speak-in-united-states.html) in 2019.

By providing [multilingual](https://digital.gov/topics/multilingual/) digital content in languages other than English, the government delivers digital services that are accessible to all communities. This leads to a more interconnected public and greater satisfaction and trust in government.

‌Two executive orders affirm the federal government’s commitment to improving language access services and ensuring full participation by individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP).

## What is translation technology?

Translation technology is a rapidly evolving field that involves the use of computer software and other tools to support the translation process.

`Computer-aided technology` and `machine translation` are two common approaches to language translation.

With computer-aided technology, the translation is created by a human translator with some aspects of the process aided by software. With machine translation, the translation is mostly automated.

The table below highlights other key differences between the two approaches.

## What are the downsides of using translation technology?

There are many downsides to using translation technologies.

Automated machine translation isn’t delivering 100% accuracy yet, but it is improving. Its accuracy depends largely on the language pair you need. For example, the most-used languages, such as English, Spanish, French, German, and Mandarin Chinese, have relatively high success rates of translations due to the large amount of data available for training machine learning models. However, less common languages and language pairs may have lower success rates due to the lack of available training data.

It’s important to consider the potential negative implications for users of a poor or inaccurate translation of health, financial, or legal information found on a government website. What is the point of having a button to translate a website if the information translated is unusable or is accompanied by a disclaimer that the government agency is not responsible for the translation’s accuracy?

Also, machine translations that dynamically generate site pages with the click of a button makes them invisible to search engines. This means that when a person searches online for information from an agency in a language other than English, the agency web page will not come up in the search results because that content does not actually exist online in that language. It was only temporarily created and presented to the user in their browser for them alone to see when they pushed the button to request the machine translation.

Another downside with automated machine translations is that they can struggle with idiomatic expressions and nuanced language use — how humans actually write and speak. In turn, these issues can make the translation sound unnatural and awkward.

But could [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://digital.gov/topics/artificial-intelligence/) make machine translation more accurate? AI — where algorithms learn human behavior and language use through neural networks — is a promising field. It has the potential of making translations more accurate as it learns, but we are still far from 100% automation.

Computer-aided technology is expensive and time-consuming now, but it can improve and lower costs as adoption grows.

## Should agencies use translation technology?

Agencies should use translation technology to create accurate, findable content. But they should not rely solely on automatic machine translation services or computer-aided technology. All translations should be checked by a competent human translator.

According to the Department of Justice’s Limited English Proficiency Committee of the Title VI Interagency Working Group:

{{< box >}}“If the entity utilizes machine translation software, the entity should have a human translator proofread all content containing vital information before posting it to ensure the accuracy of the translated information. Website content that is translated and checked by qualified human translators is more likely to be accurate and locatable by LEP users.”
— [Improving Access to Public Websites and Digital Services for Limited English Proficient (LEP) Persons (PDF, 2.4 MB, 17 pages, December 2021)](https://www.lep.gov/sites/lep/files/media/document/2021-12/2021_12_07_Website_Language_Access_Guide_508.pdf#page=5){{< /box >}}

Related, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) tells health programs covered by Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act:

{{< box >}}“[B]ecause written translation must be provided by a qualified translator, automated translation alone likely would not be sufficient. Machine translation, which is one type of automated translation technology, translates text by performing simple substitution of words using statistical techniques. Given differences across languages in syntax, figures of speech, and vocabulary, the simple substitution of words using statistical techniques may produce highly unreliable translations for certain languages and written content. A quality check performed by a qualified translator, such as reviewing the translation for accuracy and editing the translation if needed, would likely be necessary."
— Question 42 in [Section 1557: Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/section-1557/1557faqs/index.html#General%20Questions){{< /box >}}

HHS encourages the health programs to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the technology and software programs that qualified translators use.
