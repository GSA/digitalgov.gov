In response to Hurricane Helene, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is issuing guidance for the coordination of federal web and social media communications related to this incident.

The authority for this action comes from [Emergency Support Function 15](https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/national-preparedness/frameworks/response#esf) (ESF-15 - Public Affairs – Annex R) of the [National Response Framework](https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/national-preparedness/frameworks/response) where, during incidents of national significance, DHS has the authority to coordinate all U.S. government communications.

On September 26, 2024, in conjunction with the [Digital Experience Council](https://digital.gov/resources/an-introduction-to-the-digital-experience-council/), DHS issued ESF-15 guidance for federal web and social communications to support the national response to Hurricane Helene.

{{< note >}} **All federal agencies are required to follow this guidance.** {{< /note >}}

## In brief

Federal agencies with a role in the response effort should stand up an `agency.gov/hurricane-helene` or `agency.gov/helene` page. That page should link to the two primary [Lanes of Communication](#lanes-of-communication), which are:

1. What DHS and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are doing
2. What the U.S. government is doing

{{< note "action" >}}
When distributing materials related to Hurricane Helene, please include links to these two Lanes of Communication on all materials.

{{< note "action" >}}
When posting information to your agency website, please only post information related to your individual agency. Then, link to the authoritative information from other government agencies that is related to your agency mission or “lane.” Do NOT copy and paste content from other agencies or websites onto your site.

Coordinate emergency response-related web and digital communications with your [Digital Experience Council representative](https://digital.gov/resources/an-introduction-to-the-digital-experience-council/#agency-members).

{{< ring title="Requests from FEMA">}}
Amplify messaging on listening to local officials, evacuating if told to do so, and finishing preparations as Milton intensifies.

Hurricane Milton may affect areas already impacted by Hurricane Helene. Please share updates on Helene recovery while amplifying Milton response using your social accounts and tag [FEMA social media accounts](https://digital.gov/resources/hurricane-milton-guidance-for-us-government/#social-media-guidance).
