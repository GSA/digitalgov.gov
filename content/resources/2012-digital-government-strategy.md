[The 2012 Digital Government Strategy](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/digitalgov/about) mission drives agencies, and the need to deliver better services to customers at a lower cost—whether an agency is supporting the warfighter overseas, a teacher seeking classroom resources, or a family figuring out how to pay for college is pushing every level of government to look for new solutions.

The Digital Government Strategy complements several initiatives aimed at building a 21st-century government that works better for the American people. These include:

- [Executive Order 13571, Streamlining Service Delivery and Improving Customer Service](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/27/executive-order-13571-streamlining-service-delivery-and-improving-custom)
- [Executive Order 13576, Delivering an Efficient, Effective, and Accountable Government](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/06/13/executive-order-13576-delivering-efficient-effective-and-accountable-gov)
- [Presidential Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/transparency-and-open-government)
- [OMB Memorandum M-10-06, Open Government Directive](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/open/documents/open-government-directive)
- [National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace](https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2016/12/08/nsticstrategy.pdf) - ([NSTIC](https://www.nist.gov/itl/tig))
- [25-Point Implementation Plan to Reform Federal Information Technology Management](http://cio.gov/documents/25-Point-Implementation-Plan-to-Reform-FederalIT.pdf) (IT Reform)

The Digital Government Strategy incorporates a broad range of input from government practitioners, the public, and private-sector experts. Two cross-governmental working groups – the Mobility Strategy and Web Reform Task Forces – provided guidance and recommendations for building a digital government.
