## What are the NIST controls?

Federal security compliance is based on evaluating security criteria. Those criteria are a wide-ranging set of considerations called controls. The National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) defines these controls in a special publication (SP) called [NIST SP 800-53 (Revision 5), Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final).

To use, buy, or build software for the government, you need authorization to operate (ATO). A huge part of that process is documenting how you are addressing the controls in your system security and privacy plan (SSPP). During the ATO process, assessors determine what controls apply to a given system. The higher the risk of the system, the more controls. Then, that system needs to document those considerations and prove that they have taken those security measures into account. 

For an overview of ATOs, read An introduction to ATOs.

## Why worry about controls?

Understanding the controls is an important part of the ATO process. Specifically when writing a system security and privacy plan. With hundreds of controls, approaching ATOs can be quite daunting. That's why it's good to start off with an overview of the controls.

The controls are grouped by topic, and those topics are called families. Next, we'll explore each control family and what kind of considerations that control family focuses on.

## Meet the family

The three-column table below lists the 20 control families alphabetically by their two-character ID \[ID code]. Security and compliance folks often refer to the controls by this ID. For each, the ID is linked to the full list of controls for that family.

The second column provides the full name of the control family. The third column provides a plain language description of the control to give you a feel for what kind of security concern that control family covers.

T﻿ABLE

You may have noticed that many of the controls require the efforts of your whole team. To get them onboard, it helps to describe the larger objectives of your policies and procedures. Taking the time to explain controls can help everyone better contribute to your system's security and compliance.
