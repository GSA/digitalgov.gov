 Memorandum M-19-21, Transition to Electronic Records, issued jointly by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), established several requirements to move federal agencies to a fully electronic environment, where appropriate. Agencies may have been delayed in their electronic records transition process during the COVID-19 pandemic.

 This December 23, 2022 memorandum, M-23-07, Update to Transition to Electronic Records, does the following:

- Reinforces the requirements established in M-19-21.
- Reaffirms the underlying goal of the transition to electronic records.
- Updates the previous target dates described in M-19-21 to June 24, 2024

 This memorandum also describes NARAâ€™s plans to issue updated guidance, as appropriate.
