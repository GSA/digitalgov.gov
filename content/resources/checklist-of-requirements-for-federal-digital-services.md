In the federal government, standing up a new website involves all of the standard things, like selecting a content management system, designing easy-to-use templates, and creating great content that meets user needs. But it also involves ensuring that your site and content serve the public in alignment with relevant policy requirements.

## Making sense of policy requirements

You’re probably thinking, “How complicated could it be?”

You may be surprised. Over 100 laws, regulations, and policies impact federal websites, covering topics such as accessibility, privacy, security, design, and user experience.

Fortunately, GSA has developed a self-assessment checklist to help you navigate the complexities of federal web policy, so that you can confidently understand and meet the requirements for federal websites and digital services. Review the checklist for a detailed look at what it takes to manage a government website.

## What’s in the checklist?

The checklist is organized into 11 broad categories, listed below, that cover the breadth of federal web policy requirements. It explains what you need to do to meet each requirement.

* [Accessibility](https://digital.gov/topics/accessibility/) - Websites and digital services are accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities
* [Analytics](https://digital.gov/topics/analytics/) - Data-informed analysis influences management and development decisions
* [Content](https://digital.gov/topics/content-strategy/) - Content teams are empowered to edit content so it meets user needs and works well on the web
* [Customer experience](https://digital.gov/topics/customer-experience/) - Teams understand the impact of a person’s experiences on their perception of the organization
* [Design](https://digital.gov/topics/design/) - Websites and digital services are modern, consistent in appearance, designed around user needs, and fully functional on common mobile devices
* [Governance](https://digital.gov/topics/governance/) - Management processes are in place that empower web teams to improve digital experience
* [Privacy](https://digital.gov/topics/privacy/) - User information is protected
* [Search](https://digital.gov/topics/search/) - Websites contain a search function to allow users to easily search content; content is optimized for search
* [Security](https://digital.gov/topics/security/) - Content is provided through an industry standard secure connection; site meets all current security requirements
* [Software engineering](https://digital.gov/topics/software-engineering/) - Websites and digital services are secure, device-agnostic, user-friendly
* [Trust](https://digital.gov/topics/trust/) - Content is current, authoritative, unique (no duplication), and clearly identifies as an official government site

## How to use the self-assessment checklist

The ``Overview`` tab presents a dashboard, which automatically updates as you work through the rest of the tool.

The remaining tabs list requirements and guidance for each policy area. Use the drop-down in the far right ``Status`` column to indicate how much  your site is meeting the requirements (done, partial, not done) for each policy area.

The data from the ``Status`\` column will automatically populate the \``Overview`` tab as you work to provide an at-a-glance status for each policy area. The intent is to help you understand where the site is doing well, and where it could be improved.

Share the spreadsheet with your team so everyone can see the dashboard and the policy areas.

## Explore federal web policies

Policy plays a vital role in how federal agencies serve the public. With over 100 requirements for federal websites and digital services, web and digital practitioners in government need a deep and broad understanding of these policies.
