## Accessibility and Section 508

Ensure access for people with disabilities, including motor, auditory, cognitive, seizure/neurological, and visual impairments; ensure content is "perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust." Teach staff how to create accessible products, and conduct accessibility testing before launch, or when making significant changes to, digital products and services.

## Coordination during incidents of national significance

Federal websites must provide timely and accurate information during incidents of national significance. During such incidents, the Department of Homeland Security has the authority to coordinate all U.S. government communications to ensure consistent public information through an integrated federal incident communications system. Coordinate emergency response-related web communications with your [Federal Web Council representative](https://digital.gov/resources/federal-web-council/#current-council-members).

- [Emergency Support Function 15](https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/34369) (ESF-15 - Public Affairs – Annex R) of the [National Response Framework](https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/117791)

## Copyright

Inform the public about your policies on digital rights, copyrights, trademarks, and patents. If your organization uses or duplicates private sector information, protect the property rights of the source. (These protections apply to any material posted to federal public websites, such as documents, graphics, or audio files.)

- [Copyright Law](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/)

- [U.S. Copyright Office](https://www.copyright.gov/)

## Customer experience

Understand the needs of your customers, collect and address customer feedback, and use data and feedback to continuously improve your programs. Ensure that information collected from the public minimizes burden and maximizes public utility. Use social media and other third-party platforms to listen to and serve customers. Secure OMB approval before collecting information from the public (surveys, forms, etc.), and include the OMB control number on the collection. Enable digital interactions with the public and deliver services via your customers' channel of choice.

## Design

Use the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) (USWDS) to deliver a great digital experience by integrating design principles,
following user experience guidance, and using USWDS code.

Follow current government design standards when creating new websites or making significant changes to existing websites.

## Domains

Federal executive branch agency websites must use only .gov or .mil domains unless the agency head explicitly determines another domain is necessary for the proper performance of an agency function (this is rare). Coordinate with your agency CIO to request a new .gov domain. Clearly display the name of your agency on every page of the website.

- [OMB M-23-10, The Registration and Use of .gov Domains in the Federal Government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/M-23-10-DOTGOV-Act-Guidance.pdf) (PDF, 96 kb, 3 pages, February 2023); guidance to Federal agencies on the acceptable use and registration of Internet domain names
- [GOV Domain Name Registration Service](https://www.dotgov.gov/) &#8211; request a new .gov domain
- [DOTGOV Online Trust in Government Act of 2020](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/133/text/enr#:~:text=dotgov) authorizes CISA to manage the .gov registration process

- [Proactive Disclosure of Non-Exempt Agency Information: Making Information Available Without the Need to File a FOIA Request](https://www.justice.gov/oip/oip-guidance/proactive_disclosure_of_non-exempt_information)

Records that must be posted under FOIA:

- Final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as well as orders made adjudicating cases;
- Statements of policy and interpretations adopted by the agency but not published in the Federal Register;
- Administrative manuals and staff instructions that affect the public; and
- Records that have been released under FOIA, are likely to be requested or have been requested three or more times (the “Rule of Three”).

- Material that has been declassified, to the greatest extent possible.

## Governance

Establish a digital governance structure to provide accountability and enforce policies and standards. Manage and fund your digital presence as an integral part of your overall business, communications, and customer experience strategies. Leverage existing infrastructure, shared tools, best practices, and communities of practice, and coordinate within and across agencies to create efficiency and reduce duplication. When missions overlap, collaborate with other agencies to develop cross-agency websites (portals); coordinate across government to disseminate emergency response info.

## Open Government, data, and content

Publish information in ways that make it easy to find, access, share, distribute, and re-purpose; Structure content and tag with standard metadata. Make open data, content, and application programming interfaces (APIs) the new default, and make existing high-value data and content available through APIs. Use challenges and prizes to promote open government, innovation, and other national priorities.

## Paperwork reduction

Information you collect from the public should minimize burden and maximize public utility. Get OMB approval before collecting information from the public via surveys, forms, etc., and include the OMB control number on the collection. Use OMB's Fast-Track PRA Review Process to speed the PRA approval process. Use digital processes (forms, filing, signatures, etc.) and deliver services via your customers' channel of choice (online, apps, etc.) whenever possible. Designate a single point of contact for small businesses, and post the contact information on your website.

## Performance measurement and reporting

Regularly evaluate all digital products for performance and cost effectiveness by collecting and acting on metrics and customer feedback, conducting usability testing, and measuring return on investment. Establish performance measures to demonstrate mission achievement; Make your annual performance plans readily available to the public.

- [Government Performance and Results (GPRA) Modernization Act of 2010](https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/2142)

## Plain writing

Federal executive branch agencies are required to write all new or significantly revised publications, forms and publicly distributed documents in a "clear, concise, well-organized" manner.

## Privacy and identity management

Implement security and management controls to prevent the inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information. Provide service through a secure connection.
