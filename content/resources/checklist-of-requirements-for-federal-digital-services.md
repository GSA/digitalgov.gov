## Coordination During Incidents of National Significance

Federal websites must provide timely and accurate information during incidents of national significance. During such incidents, the Department of Homeland Security has the authority to coordinate all U.S. government communications to ensure consistent public information through an integrated federal incident communications system. Coordinate emergency response-related web communications with your [Federal Web Council representative](https://digital.gov/resources/federal-web-council/#current-council-members).

* [Emergency Support Function 15](https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/34369) (ESF-15 - Public Affairs – Annex R) of the [National Response Framework](https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/117791)

## Copyright

Inform the public about your policies on digital rights, copyrights, trademarks, and patents. If your organization uses or duplicates private sector information, protect the property rights of the source. (These protections apply to any material posted to federal public websites, such as documents, graphics, or audio files.)

## Customer Experience

Understand the needs of your customers, collect and address customer feedback, and use data and feedback to continuously improve your programs. Ensure that information collected from the public minimizes burden and maximizes public utility. Use social media and other third-party platforms to listen to and serve customers. Secure OMB approval before collecting information from the public (surveys, forms, etc.), and include the OMB control number on the collection. Enable digital interactions with the public and deliver services via your customers' channel of choice.

## Design

Use the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) (USWDS) to deliver a great digital experience by integrating design principles,
following user experience guidance, and using USWDS code.

Follow current government design standards when creating new websites or making significant changes to existing websites.

- [Website standards](https://designsystem.digital.gov/website-standards/), as defined in [21st Century IDEA]({{< ref "/resources/21st-century-integrated-digital-experience-act.md" >}})

## Domains

Federal executive branch agency websites must use only .gov or .mil domains unless the agency head explicitly determines another domain is necessary for the proper performance of an agency function. The 2011 freeze on creation of new .gov domains has been lifted; coordinate with agency CIO and GSA to request a new .gov domain. Clearly display the name of your agency on every page on the website.

* [GOV Domain Name Registration Service](https://www.dotgov.gov/) &#8211; request a new .gov domain
* [Final Rule – 41 CFR Part 102-173](https://www.dotgov.gov/portal/web/dotgov/policy) authorizes GSA to manage the .gov registration process

## Governance

Establish a digital governance structure to provide accountability and enforce policies and standards. Manage and fund your digital presence as an integral part of your overall business, communications, and customer experience strategies. Leverage existing infrastructure, shared tools, best practices, and communities of practice, and coordinate within and across agencies to create efficiency and reduce duplication. When missions overlap, collaborate with other agencies to develop cross-agency websites (portals); coordinate across government to disseminate emergency response info.
