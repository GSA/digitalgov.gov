## What is digital governance?

Governance can be defined as the act or process of governing or overseeing the control and direction of something (such as a country or an organization). For federal agencies, digital governance refers to the internal systems and processes we use to manage our digital presence, including:

* Establishing clear operating rules
* Defining responsibilities and lines of authority
* Creating mechanisms to ensure those rules and authorities are followed

## Why is digital governance important?

Just as a magazine has an editor-in-chief, someone must be in charge of the public’s experience on a federal government website. Digital governance clarifies who’s responsible for the management and operation of your agency’s websites and digital services. It includes content, design, technical infrastructure, security, funding, and product, project, and program management. A strong governance structure improves [public trust](https://digital.gov/resources/an-introduction-to-trust/) through better organizational performance, and better customer outcomes.

## How to implement digital governance

Every federal agency should have an enterprise-wide governance structure that provides both high-level strategic direction and oversight, as well as day-to-day management and coordination of digital initiatives.

Another key component of governance is to ensure that employees who manage digital properties have appropriate language in their position descriptions  describing these duties. Accurate position descriptions enable employees to get credit in their performance plans for this important and complex work. Senior leaders should also have appropriate language in their performance plans related to digital service delivery, to ensure accountability and oversight. 

In addition to a website manager, [Who’s on your digital dream team?](https://digital.gov/2020/05/27/whos-on-your-digital-dream-team/) explains the various roles your agency should include on your web team(s).

For example, at the General Services Administration (GSA), we operate a Digital Experience Executive Board, supported by an agency-wide Digital Council. The Board is composed of senior executives who provide high-level direction, and Council members coordinate implementation of digital initiatives within their business line. We also have an Enterprise Digital Experience team to coordinate enterprise improvements to our agency’s digital experience. Read more about [digital governance at GSA](https://digital.gov/2023/02/23/digital-governance-at-gsa/). Note that digital governance may look different at your agency, depending on how digital teams and functions are organized.

At GSA, we also [defined the work of a website manager](https://digital.gov/2023/03/24/who-is-your-website-manager/) and identified one website manager for each digital property. Then, we updated their position descriptions.

## How to identify your agency digital experience delivery lead

[OMB M-23-22: Delivering a digital-first public experience](https://digital.gov/resources/21st-century-integrated-digital-experience-act/) requires federal agencies to identify a primary point-of-contact to coordinate implementation. 

{{< card-policy src="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/ofcio/delivering-a-digital-first-public-experience/" kicker="Law" title="**MEMO M-23-22, Section IV.A.1: Immediate Agency Action Item #1**" >}}
**A. Immediate Agency Actions**

1. **Identify digital experience delivery lead:** Within 30 days of the date of this memorandum, agencies shall identify a primary point-of-contact within their organization responsible for communicating information to the relevant stakeholders across the agency, providing requested information to OMB, engaging with other agencies to share best practices for implementation, and overseeing efforts to align with the requirements and recommendations of this memorandum.
2. **Identify public-facing websites:** Within 90 days, agencies shall review data maintained by GSA’s Site Scanning Program and identify public-facing websites to OMB.
3. **Identify and assess top websites:** Within 180 days, agencies shall analyze available web metrics (e.g., through GSA’s Digital Analytics Program) to identify the public-facing websites that generate the top 80 percent of traffic (based on average monthly users) and provide this list to OMB. Agencies should review available automated scanning data (e.g., through GSA’s Site Scanning Program) for these sites to assess conformance and prioritize actions related to the requirements and recommendations of this memorandum.
4. **Assess common questions and top web content for deduplication and SEO:** Within 180 days, agencies shall identify the most common questions received across all channels (e.g., online search, social media, message boards, chat, email, phone, in person); review available web metrics to identify top pages for common searches; and conduct a high-level review of potentially duplicative or substantively similar content across websites within the agency or across agencies. Agencies shall provide to OMB a list, in aggregate across channels, of the 25 to 50 most commonly asked questions and a list of no less than 10 opportunities to retire, consolidate, or explain duplicative web content; redesign or rewrite underperforming web content; or further optimize web content to improve search engine results.
5. **Assess top tasks for self-service optimization:** Within 180 days, agencies that provide services to the public shall review the highest volume public-facing services and identify the tasks required to access each service as well as the channels available to complete each task (e.g., online, phone, mail, in person). Agencies shall provide to OMB a list of opportunities for no less than 5 top tasks that can be newly designed or further optimized as self-service digital options.
6. **Inventory public-facing services:** Within 180 days of the release of the Federal Services Index, each agency shall develop and submit a preliminary inventory to the Federal Services Index[86] of all public-facing services. For each service that cannot be made available in a digital format, the agency must provide the information specified by section 4(d) of the 21st Century IDEA. Within one year of the release of the Federal Services Index, agencies shall finalize the inventory and make it publicly available online.

There are some things to consider when making this decision. Your agency point-of-contact should have:

* A leadership role in your existing agency digital governance structure
* A leadership role in governmentwide communities of practice
* Influence in the management of the flagship \`agency.gov\` website
* Experience interpreting and implementing web and digital policy
* Ability to coordinate across agency business lines

Once your agency identifies your digital experience delivery lead, submit their name and contact information using the online form, [Agency action #1: Identify digital experience delivery lead](https://touchpoints.app.cloud.gov/touchpoints/37ac6817/submit).
