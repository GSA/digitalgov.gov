## What is digital governance?

Governance can be defined as the act or process of governing or overseeing the control and direction of something (such as a country or an organization). For federal agencies, digital governance refers to the internal systems and processes we use to manage our digital presence, including:

* Establishing clear operating rules
* Defining responsibilities and lines of authority
* Creating mechanisms to ensure those rules and authorities are followed

## Why is digital governance important?

Just as a magazine has an editor-in-chief, someone must be in charge of the public’s experience on a federal government website. Digital governance clarifies who’s responsible for the management and operation of your agency’s websites and digital services. It includes content, design, technical infrastructure, security, funding, and product, project, and program management. A strong governance structure improves [public trust](https://digital.gov/resources/an-introduction-to-trust/) through better organizational performance, and better customer outcomes.

## How to implement digital governance

Every federal agency should have an enterprise-wide governance structure that provides both high-level strategic direction and oversight, as well as day-to-day management and coordination of digital initiatives.

Another key component of governance is to ensure that employees who manage digital properties have appropriate language in their position descriptions  describing these duties. Accurate position descriptions enable employees to get credit in their performance plans for this important and complex work. Senior leaders should also have appropriate language in their performance plans related to digital service delivery, to ensure accountability and oversight.

In addition to a website manager, [Who’s on your digital dream team?](https://digital.gov/2020/05/27/whos-on-your-digital-dream-team/) explains the various roles your agency should include on your web team(s).

{{< ring title="Case study">}}

For example, at the General Services Administration (GSA), we operate a Digital Experience Executive Board, supported by an agency-wide Digital Council. The Board is composed of senior executives who provide high-level direction, and Council members coordinate implementation of digital initiatives within their business line. We also have an Enterprise Digital Experience team to coordinate enterprise improvements to our agency’s digital experience. Read more about [digital governance at GSA](https://digital.gov/2023/02/23/digital-governance-at-gsa/). Note that digital governance may look different at your agency, depending on how digital teams and functions are organized.

At GSA, we also [defined the work of a website manager](https://digital.gov/2023/03/24/who-is-your-website-manager/) and identified one website manager for each digital property. Then, we updated their position descriptions.

## How to identify your agency digital experience delivery lead

[OMB M-23-22: Delivering a digital-first public experience](https://digital.gov/resources/21st-century-integrated-digital-experience-act/) requires federal agencies to identify a primary point-of-contact to coordinate implementation.

{{< card-policy src="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/ofcio/delivering-a-digital-first-public-experience/" kicker="Law" title="**MEMO M-23-22, Section IV.A.1: Immediate Agency Actions, Number 1**" >}}
**A. Immediate Agency Actions**

1. **Identify digital experience delivery lead:** Within 30 days of the date of this memorandum, agencies shall identify a primary point-of-contact within their organization responsible for communicating information to the relevant stakeholders across the agency, providing requested information to OMB, engaging with other agencies to share best practices for implementation, and overseeing efforts to align with the requirements and recommendations of this memorandum.

{{< /card-policy >}}


There are some things to consider when making this decision. Your agency point-of-contact should have:

* A leadership role in your existing agency digital governance structure
* A leadership role in governmentwide communities of practice
* Influence in the management of the flagship `agency.gov` website
* Experience interpreting and implementing web and digital policy
* Ability to coordinate across agency business lines

Once your agency identifies your digital experience delivery lead, submit their name and contact information using the online form, [Agency action #1: Identify digital experience delivery lead](https://touchpoints.app.cloud.gov/touchpoints/37ac6817/submit).
