The [**Connected Government Act**](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2331) (H.R.2331) was signed into law on January 10, 2018, and requires new and redesigned federal agency public websites to be mobile-friendly. The [General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov/) (GSA) and [Office of Management and Budget](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/) (OMB) will submit a report to Congress in 2019 that describes how agencies can implement the law and assess their compliance.

The new law codifies OMB Memorandum M-17-06, [Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites and Digital Services](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/legacy_drupal_files/omb/memoranda/2017/m-17-06.pdf) (PDF, 1.2 MB, 18 pages, November 2016).

The sections below were curated by the [MobileGov Community of Practice](https://digital.gov/communities/mobile/) to help you make sure that your websites comply with the law.

## What Is Mobile-Friendly?

Mobile-friendly means a digital product can be navigated, viewed and accessed on a smartphone, tablet computer, or similar mobile device.

- **Is Your Site Mobile-Friendly?** <br />Many of us get toward the end of mobile site development and really do not know if what we created is “mobile-friendly.” We think we have followed all of the mobile best practices and performed usability testing. However, do we have something concrete to quantitatively certify that we are mobile-friendly? <br />[https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/10/23/is-your-site-mobile-friendly/](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/10/23/is-your-site-mobile-friendly/)

### Agency Examples and Recommendations

Resources to help your agency comply with the Connected Government Act.

- **Mobile User Experience Guidelines and Recommendations** <br />As more agencies develop mobile apps and websites, they need quick guidance on mobile user experience Do’s and Don’ts. To answer their call, we asked MobileGov Community of Practice members to choose their top Mobile UX Guidelines from the original group of 42. From that feedback, we have distilled the following six mobile user experience guidelines. <br />https://digital.gov/resources/mobile-user-experience-guidelines-and-recommendations/

## Design for Your Users

Great mobile design requires all the best practices from Human Centered Design and should provide consistent information as other agency channels.

- **You’ll Have Them at Swipe: Making An Awesome Mobile User Experience Webinar** <br />In this webinar, MobileGov developers from the National Institutes of Health and Department of Veterans Affairs talk about how mobile user experience is different from traditional channels, discuss how to approach user experience during mobile implementations, and demonstrate their successful practices. <br />https://www.digitalgov.gov/2013/02/11/youll-have-them-at-swipe-making-an-awesome-mobile-user-experience-webinar/

- **Open and Structured Content Models Workshop Recap** <br />The Open and Structured Content Models Working Group, an interagency working group, has been exploring the approach for government and they have created two open and structured content models—one for articles and one for events. They hosted a workshop so agencies could hear from a few organizations who are already putting these ideas into practice. Attendees discussed how to build the case for the content model approach, how the models work in practice and how to implement the existing models. <br />https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/10/27/open-and-structured-content-models-workshop-recap/
- **Mobile Content: Less is More** <br />How big is your smartphone? Way smaller than a desktop monitor. The user will have a radically different experience on a desktop, and they are usually expecting a different experience. <br />https://www.digitalgov.gov/2015/08/31/mobile-content-less-is-more/
- **How to Make a Mobile Paper Prototype** <br />Well before we get into the design and coding phases, we can show customers a mockup of an idea of what our product might look like. It’s called a prototype (or a wireframe)—it’s a model of a design that’s still in development. It doesn’t need to be fancy, or even made on a computer. But it can make the difference between a product that looks good and one that people will actually use. <br />https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/05/22/how-to-make-a-mobile-paper-prototype/
- **Design Sketching: The Easiest Prototype Method Ever** <br />Smart designers create a “low-fidelity” prototype of your product—a rough approximation of what it’s going to look like so people can actually interact with it. <br />https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/08/08/design-sketching-the-easiest-prototype-method-ever/
