The [21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5759/text), otherwise known as 21st Century IDEA, was signed into law in December 2018. The Act aims to improve the digital experience for government customers and reinforces existing requirements for federal public websites.


## Why Is It Important?

In 2019, there were over [14 billion sessions and 38 billion page views](https://analytics.usa.gov/) on federal websites. Customer expectations are being ratcheted up by the private sector. Government services should be delivered in ways the public now demands and expects—quick, easy, secure, and accessible.

We can, and should, do more.

**21st Century IDEA is a significant opportunity** to improve the lives of the public by transforming how government uses technology. It is a way to make this change happen, and it provides a clear, practical path forward.


## What’s in the Law?

So what is in 21st Century IDEA? The bill’s sponsor, Representative Ro Khanna, summed it up by saying, _“Government exists to serve citizens, and this bill ensures government leverages available technology to provide cohesive, user-friendly online service that people around this country expect and deserve.”_

Specifically, the Act requires all executive branch agencies to:

- modernize their websites,
- digitize services and forms,
- accelerate use of e-signatures,
- improve customer experience, and
- standardize and transition to centralized [shared services]({{< ref "/services/_index.md" >}}).

It also requires agencies to comply with the [website standards](https://designsystem.digital.gov/website-standards/), using the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/).
