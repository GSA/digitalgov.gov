On January 21, 2009, the President issued a memorandum calling for the establishment of “a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration.” The memorandum required an Open Government Directive to be issued by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), instructing “executive departments and agencies to take specific actions implementing the principles set forth in this memorandum.”

OMB’s Open Government Directive requires a series of measures to promote the commitments to transparency, participation, and collaboration. As the Internet continues to evolve, the Federal Government has new opportunities to promote these commitments by engaging with citizens, explaining what Federal agencies are doing, seeking public comments, and improving the delivery of services. In the private sector, it has become standard for commercial websites to use web measurement and customization technologies to engage with members of the public.
