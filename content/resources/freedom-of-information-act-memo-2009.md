The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is the law that gives anyone the right to access information from the federal government. It is often described as the law that keeps citizens in the know about their government. This [2009 FOIA memo](http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ag/legacy/2009/06/24/foia-memo-march2009.pdf) covers the following:

* An agency should not withhold information simply because it may do so legally.
* Whenever an agency determines that it cannot make full disclosure of a requested record, it must consider whether it can make partial disclosure.

The disclosure obligation under the FOIA is not absolute. The Act provides exemptions to protect, for example, national security, personal privacy, privileged records, and law enforcement interests
