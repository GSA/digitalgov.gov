## What is Section 508?

[Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973](https://www.access-board.gov/about/law/ra.html) seeks to eliminate barriers to using technology. In 1998, President Clinton signed into law the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998, which covers access to federally funded programs and services. The law strengthens Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and requires access to electronic and information technology provided by the federal government. Specifically, federal agencies must ensure that information and communication technology is accessible to employees and members of the public with disabilities by complying with the Section 508 standards issued by the U.S. Access Board.

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires the U.S. Access Board to issue and publish [accessibility standards](https://www.access-board.gov/ict/) that provide technical requirements for federal information and communication technology to ensure accessibility and usability by individuals with disabilities.  On January 18, 2017, the Access Board issued a final rule that updated the accessibility standards covered by Section 508. The final rule went into effect on January 18, 2018.

In December 2023, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued [M-24-08, Strengthening Digital Accessibility and the Management of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/ofcio/m-24-08-strengthening-digital-accessibility-and-the-management-of-section-508-of-the-rehabilitation-act/). This memo provides guidance to help agencies advance digital accessibility by:

* Maintaining an accessible federal technology environment.
* Promoting accessible digital experiences.
* Continuing implementation of accessibility standards in accordance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.

In part, this memo provides policy guidance to help federal agencies integrate digital accessibility into their everyday services and operations. Together, the law, standards, and policy guidance establish a framework for strengthening and maintaining the federal government's commitment to digital accessibility.

## Why is accessibility important?

Disability impacts all of us. Up to [one in four adults in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html) (27%) have some type of disability, many of which are hidden or not recognizable.

Technology is a fundamental part of our daily routines — making it critical that technology remains accessible for everyone. Adopting digital accessibility best practices ensures we are serving the diverse needs of both the public and the federal workforce.

Aside from the legal requirements, accessibility is good for business. Creating products and information that everyone can use [drives innovation](https://digital.gov/topics/innovation/), improves [customer experience](https://digital.gov/topics/customer-experience/), and [builds public trust in government](https://digital.gov/topics/trust/). Accessibility also helps you reach more stakeholders and, ultimately, achieve your agency’s mission.

## What are the laws and policies?

“Section 508” is often used colloquially as shorthand to refer to the various IT accessibility laws, regulations, and policies.

Together, these laws, regulations, and policies describe how to develop, procure, maintain, and use information and communication technology that are accessible to users with disabilities. This work applies to technology used by federal employees, as well as members of the public who use federal websites, digital services, and other technology.

## What does it mean to strengthen digital accessibility and the management of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act?

### Focus areas

OMB’s policy guidance in M-24-08 outlines six areas for agencies to focus on to build and sustain an accessible federal technology environment:

1. Establish digital accessibility programs and policies
2. Buy accessible products and services
3. Design and develop accessible digital experiences
4. Create, communicate, and deliver accessible content
5. Evaluate, monitor, and collect feedback to improve accessibility
6. Cultivate a positive culture of digital accessibility

M-24-08 rescinds following four OMB memos:

1. The Strategic Plan for Improving Management of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (published by OMB on January 24, 2013)
2. Improving the Accessibility of Government Information (published by OMB on July 19, 2010)
3. Ensuring the Accessibility of Federal Electronic and Information Technologies Procured by Federal Agencies (published by OMB on November 6, 2007)
4. Buying Accessible Electronic and Information Technology and Complying with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (published by OMB on August 11, 2005)

### Agency reporting actions

OMB’s policy guidance in M-24-08 also requires agencies to complete a series of actions after the memo’s issuance on December 21, 2023.

* Within `30 days` of issuance (by January 20, 2024), agencies must report the name and contact information of the agency-wide Section 508 program manager to OMB. After this action, agencies are required to report any changes to the designated agency-wide Section 508 program manager to OMB within 30 days.
* Within `90 days` of issuance (by March 20, 2024), agencies must have digital [accessibility statements](https://www.section508.gov/manage/laws-and-policies/website-accessibility-statement/) on all agency websites.
* Within `90 days` of issuance (by March 20, 2024), agencies must have a public feedback mechanism for receiving complaints or reports about accessibility issues with agency websites and digital services and begin to track, review, and address feedback.
* Within `180 days` of issuance (by June 18, 2024), agencies must [assess their policies](https://www.section508.gov/manage/policy-framework/introduction/) to ensure that accessibility considerations are incorporated in all relevant agency functions; develop a plan to update agency policies to align with the requirements of this memorandum, as needed; ensure any changes to policies are also updated in agency digital strategies; and make accessibility policies publicly available.
* `Each year`, agencies must report on their compliance with Section 508, in accordance with [criteria and instructions disseminated by OMB and published on Section508.gov](https://www.section508.gov/manage/section-508-assessment/).
