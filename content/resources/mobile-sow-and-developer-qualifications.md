Structuring a Statement of Work (SOW) for the development or modification of mobile products should be similar to any SOW your government organization issues for IT products and services.

We are providing sample SOW language for the procurement of customer/external-facing mobile products, skills, testing and mobile code sharing. This language is also included in the [RFP-EZ contracting tool]({{< ref "2013-05-06-cracking-the-mobile-contracting-nut.md" >}} "Cracking the Mobile Contracting Nut"). Here are some guidelines for its use.

1. The sample SOW language is offered as a starting point for agency program managers to adapt to fit their mobile procurement needs.
2. The language was created by leveraging existing mobile procurements developed by members of the Mobile Innovators Network (link) as well as industry practices for mobile development. Not every agency is the same, but agencies generally were looking for these skills.
3. Agency managers should include the relevant skills needed to work with their current and/or future agency IT systems for mobile development.
4. Mobile products and their development skills are evolving and we will make every attempt to keep this language updated, but visiting platforms&#8217; developer sites (<a href="http://developer.android.com" rel="nofollow">Android</a>, <a href="http://developer.blackberry.com" rel="nofollow">Blackberry</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com" rel="nofollow">iOS</a>, <a href="http://developer.windowsphone.com/en-us" rel="nofollow">Windows</a>, [HTML5](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/)) will ensure your requirements are fresh.
5. Finally, and perhaps most important government users need to collaborate with their contracting officers when writing mobile product procurements.

## <a name="Ongoing Mobile Development Sample SOW"></a>Ongoing Mobile Development Sample SOW<a name="CompleteSOW"></a> {#toc0}

Some agencies have developed an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) mobile SOW for mobile product development long term. Many program offices have created SOW’s for mobile development. When creating a mobile SOW, it is important to cover all current and future development tasks. Be clear about what current systems the mobile products will be leveraged on and potential update information. The sample language below can help for current mobile development skills for contractors.

## <a name="Sample Language for Specific Mobile Products"></a>Sample Language for Specific Mobile Products<a name="SpecificSOW"></a> {#toc2}

Some mobile innovators have sought a specific mobile product (app, mobile website, etc.). Below we have collected some language for specific mobile products (specific one off procurements.)

### <a name="Sample Language for Specific Mobile Products-Mobile Web Site / Responsive Design Web Site"></a>Mobile Web Site / Responsive Design Web Site<a name="MobileWebSOW"></a> {#toc3}

A mobile website refers to a site that is designed to be accessed by mobile Web browsers. Responsive design sites adjust content to fit the size of a person’s device screen.

##### <a name="Sample Language for Specific Mobile Products-Mobile Web Site / Responsive Design Web Site--Sample SOW Language"></a>Sample SOW Language {#toc4}

**Sample #1**

- _Provide mobile (phone and tablet) support and maintenance for multiple screen sizes. Updates (content, design, functionality, etc.) available on the (Agency’s URL) website (PC experience) shall be optimized for phone and tablet experiences (mobile web) through responsive design._
- _Provide creative design support, based on the Agency&#8217;s digital style guide, for future enhancements following 508 accessibility guidelines._
- _Perform unit and unit integration testing. Provide support during all test phases (System, Intersystem, and User Acceptance Testing). Support and coordinate with the Enterprise Performance Test Team and support the Department’s 508 Accessibility Group testing of the application._

### <a name="Sample Language for Specific Mobile Products-Web App"></a>Web App<a name="WebAppSOW"></a> {#toc5}

Applications accessed through the internet on mobile browsers are called mobile web apps. These applications are developed with web technologies like HTML, JQuery and JavaScript. Popular social media applications like Facebook and Gmail have their separate mobile based web apps which are very famous among mobile users.

Web apps generally have simpler functionality, will need network access to work properly, and will look more like a website than an app.

##### <a name="Sample Language for Specific Mobile Products-Web App--Sample SOW Language"></a>Sample SOW Language {#toc6}

**Sample #1**

- _The SOW seeks design, development, installation, training and maintenance of scalable, user centric, high performance mobile website(s). The mobile websites should fully work in multiple browsers and device platforms. The contractor should have experience in mobile strategy and building mobile web apps of similar size and scope. The contractor is expected to use the industry best practices to all aspects of the contract in order to deliver value to USG. Mobile development and services requested are for Windows phone, iOS and Android etc.The agency should also specify if there are any Content management system or any other app that the mobile web app needs to interact with)._

### <a name="Sample Language for Specific Mobile Products-Hybrid Apps"></a>Hybrid Apps<a name="HybridSOW"></a> {#toc7}

Hybrid apps combine elements of both web and native mobile apps. In such applications, web apps are embedded into native mobile apps. User interface is normally covered in the native part of the application while content is loaded through web part of the application. Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter apps installed on a mobile are best examples where application interface is installed but contents is loaded from the web.

While hybrid apps are not as simple as web apps, they will need network access to function. Agencies also leverage cross development platforms for native apps.

##### <a name="Sample Language for Specific Mobile Products-Hybrid Apps--Sample SOW Language"></a>Sample SOW Language {#toc8}

**Sample #1**

- _The Contractor shall design and develop the mobile application in a way that provides a similar theme yet device-specific experience for users depending on what type of device they are on. The two types supported shall be smart phones and tablets._
- _The Contractor shall understand and execute the necessary processes to deploy the mobile application to Apple, Google and Windows marketplaces._
- _The Contractor shall design and develop an app that appropriately represents the competitive and exclusive nature of the [AGENCY] brand, and creates an app environment that encourages and facilitates habitual use via gamification._
- _The app shall be a hybrid of content packaged into the app’s native code as well as content that is piped in from the web using both RSS feeds and web views of externally hosted html pages._
- _The app shall work regardless of the user’s connectivity to the internet, as well as give users the option to download and save content to a personal “reading list” for access later regardless of the user’s connectivity to the internet._
- _The app shall leverage push notification capabilities in order to remind users about upcoming events._
- _The Contractor shall design and develop an app home screen to highlight roughly five Agency featured headlines per day that reside on the Agency website._

### <a name="Sample Language for Specific Mobile Products-Native Apps"></a>Native Apps<a name="NativeSOW"></a> {#toc9}

A native application or app is an application program that has been developed for use on a particular platform or device. When writing an SOW for a native app, it’s important to properly explain the functionalities of the app.

##### <a name="Sample Language for Specific Mobile Products-Native Apps--Sample SOW Language"></a>Sample SOW Language {#toc10}

**Sample #1**

- _The SOW seeks design, development, installation, and maintenance of scalable, high performance, user centric Native apps. The contractor should have experience in mobile strategy and building native apps of similar size and scope. The contractor is expected to use the industry best practices to all aspects of the contract in order to deliver value to USG. Mobile development and services requested are for iOS and Android etc (Note: Agency can specify any other platform they need to contractor to support. The agency should also specify if there are any Content management system that the native app needs to interact with.)_

**Sample #2**

- _Provide development and support (operations and maintenance) for mobile (smartphone and tablet) native applications (e.g. iOS, Android, Blackberry, Windows Phone, etc.)_

## <a name="Mobile Key Personnel Skill Templates"></a>Mobile Key Personnel Skill Templates<a name="KeySkills"></a> {#toc11}

Building mobile websites/apps requires people with specific skill sets. Agency SOW’s have sought key personnel and even teams as contained in the language below. Agencies should keep in mind that these skills are evolving and agencies should include relevant skills need to work with current and/or future agency systems.

**Please Note:** There are redundancies in these lists as they are an amalgamation of SOWs. Agencies should pick the skills applicable for their project(s) and disregard the rest.

## <a name="Mobile Product Testing"></a>Mobile Product Testing<a name="Testing"></a> {#toc20}

Once an agency builds a mobile product, it needs to test it. Please view these [mobile testing guidelines]({{< ref "2013-08-22-mobile-product-testing-guidelines.md" >}} "Mobile Product Testing Guidelines and Resources") for more information on mobile product testing. Here is some Sample SOW Language for mobile product testing.

The Contractor shall ensure the software is production-ready, and operates on the intranet and Internet environments provided by the USG._
  _**User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**_
  _The Contractor shall support and coordinate all UAT efforts with Information security and assurance team members._

## <a name="Mobile Code Ownership/Open Sourcing"></a>Mobile Code Ownership/Open Sourcing<a name="Code"></a> {#toc21}

Agencies are <a href="http://gsa.github.io/Mobile-Code-Catalog/" rel="nofollow">adopting open government and open source methods</a> by creating API’s and sharing other types of code to make mobile development easier. Agencies should include language in their mobile product SOW’s in order to leverage third party developers and other methods.

You should consult your contracting officer for specific language, but <a href="http://www.acquisition.gov/far/html/52_227.html" rel="nofollow">FAR code 52.227.17</a> generally addresses Authorization and Consent. Agencies need to identify a list of deliverables/types of code that they will own and what is patentable by the contracting organization. This is necessary if you wish to publish the code written by the contractor for your contract under a license where the government asserts copyright ownership. This is generally not necessary if you are just USING open source code or APIs.

Consult with legal and your procurement officer for your agency&#8217;s procedures.

##### <a name="Mobile Code Ownership/Open Sourcing---Sample SOW Language"></a>Sample SOW Language {#toc22}_All products, designs, drawings and outputs developed as part of the activities conducted on this contract/order will be considered the property of the Government and may serve as input on subsequent orders, or other contractual vehicle as deemed appropriate. Offerors shall not submit as proprietary data in their proposal or quotation any restrictions that will limit the Government’s ownership and right to use the data generated, products, designs, drawings, and outputs developed under this award._
