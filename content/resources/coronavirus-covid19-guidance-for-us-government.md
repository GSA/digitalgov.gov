In response to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and in conjunction with the White House, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the [Federal Web Council](https://digital.gov/resources/federal-web-council/), the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is issuing guidance for the coordination of Federal web and social media communications related to this incident.

This authority for this action comes from [Emergency Support Function 15](https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/34369) (ESF-15 - Public Affairs – Annex R) of the [National Response Framework](https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/117791) where, during incidents of national significance, DHS has the authority to coordinate all USG communications.

On March 11, 2020, DHS activated ESF-15 for Federal web and social communications to support the national response to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

{{< note >}} **All Federal agencies are required to follow this guidance.** {{< /note >}}

<!-- {{< img src="2871-lores" >}} -->

## In Brief

Federal agencies with a role in the response effort should stand up an `agency.gov/coronavirus` page. That page must contain the following links for the three primary [lanes of communication](#lanes-of-communication):

- [Coronavirus.gov](https://www.coronavirus.gov/) — White House Coronavirus Task Force
- [Coronavirus Disease 2019](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) (COVID-19) — CDC
- [Government Response to Coronavirus](https://www.usa.gov/coronavirus) — USAgov

In addition, use your agency coronavirus page to communicate what your agency is doing to support the response effort and link to [featured content](#content-to-feature) as appropriate. Also follow the [guidance for social media](#social-media-guidance). Coordinate emergency response-related web communications with your [Federal Web Council]({{< ref "/resources/federal-web-council.md" >}}) representative.

Link to authoritative information from other government agencies related to your agency mission or ”lane.” Do NOT copy and paste content from other agencies/websites onto your site.

## Content to Feature

The White House, in collaboration with DHS and HHS, encourages agencies to feature the following content on both their agency homepages and coronavirus pages as appropriate.

### Last updated June 12, 2020:

**Publishing Operating Status of Federal Public Facilities**: [OMB M-20-23 - Aligning Federal Agency Operations with the National Guidelines for Opening Up America Again](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/M-20-23.pdf) (section II, page 9) requires federal agencies to publish the operating status of their public facilities on their website.

As your agency begins to reopen public-facing facilities, please publish this information on your `agency.gov/coronavirus` page to help people easily determine which federal facilities are currently open to the public.

GSA, in collaboration with OPM, will maintain a comprehensive list of the operational status of federal public facilities on USA.gov.

Here’s what you should do:

- Also include up-to date facility status information on your site where customers would look for such information (e.g., Contact Us or About Us pages)
- Make the facility status information easy to link to, so when someone follows the link, they'll see the info right away
- Include markup so search engines can more easily find and disseminate the information
    - Bing tips on marking up [organizations](https://www.bing.com/webmaster/help/markup-businesses-and-organizations-cc507c09) and [special announcements](https://www.bing.com/webmaster/help/special-announcement-specifications-5cbd6249)
    - Google tips on marking up [organizations](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/local-business) and [special announcements](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/special-announcements)
    - Learn how [USA.gov applies SpecialAnnouncement markup](https://digital.gov/2020/05/11/experimenting-with-specialannouncement-markup/) to make COVID-19 information easier to find in search results

Please contact your [Federal Web Council representative](https://digital.gov/resources/federal-web-council/) if you have questions.

## Web Guidance

First, when standing up a page on your website specific to COVID-19, please **FOLLOW THE REQUESTED URL STRUCTURE** to the best of your ability: `https://www.agency.gov/coronavirus`

Second, **STAY IN YOUR LANE**. Only post information directly related to your agency on your agency’s Coronavirus page.

- Once your agency’s page is live, please **FORWARD THE LINK** to [usagovemergency@gsa.gov](mailto:usagovemergency@gsa.gov) for inclusion on the “What the U.S. Government is Doing” lane on USA.gov.

- If you add a significant news release or update to the public, please **FORWARD THE URL OF THE ARTICLE** to [usagovemergency@gsa.gov](mailto:usagovemergency@gsa.gov) for inclusion as well.

Third, **LINK TO THE <a href="#lanes-of-communication">PRIMARY LANES OF COMMUNICATION**</a> for the disease.

- Link to all three lanes <a href="#lanes-of-communication">**(see below)**</a> from all publicly-released materials related to COVID-19.

- Link to all three lanes prominently on your agency’s Coronavirus page.

- Link to any (or all) of the three lanes elsewhere on your agency website as appropriate.

- If your agency has agency-specific coronavirus information (where you “own” that lane), promote that specific information on your homepage BEFORE promoting the three lanes. It doesn’t make sense for [coronavirus.gov](https://www.coronavirus.gov/) or [usa.gov/coronavirus](https://www.usa.gov/coronavirus) to send people your way to have the public be first presented a link back to [coronavirus.gov](https://www.coronavirus.gov/).

- If your agency does not have agency-specific coronavirus information to present, include a link to [coronavirus.gov](https://www.coronavirus.gov/) on the homepage of your agency website. Prominence of display and additional locations to place the link is at agency discretion and should be based on user analytics (focus on where your users would be looking for this kind of information).

Fourth, at this point, please **DO NOT CREATE A LOGO** or any other distinct visual treatment for COVID-19. To provide for some level of consistency of presentation, a high-resolution copy of the image that CDC has been using can be found at [https://phil.cdc.gov/Details.aspx?pid=2871](https://phil.cdc.gov/Details.aspx?pid=2871).

Fifth, learn more about how to update your web pages with Schema.org’s newly released tags in the post on WhiteHouse.gov, [Connecting Americans to Coronavirus Information Online](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/connecting-americans-coronavirus-information-online/).

Follow the guidance below to implement Schema.org tags on all relevant pages with coronavirus content:

- [Bing Webmaster special announcement specifications](https://www.bing.com/webmaster/help/special-announcement-specifications-5cbd6249)

- [Google Search Console best practices for health websites](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9781983?hl=en)

- [Google tips on adding structured data to COVID-19 announcements](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/special-announcements)
