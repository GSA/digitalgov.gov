In response to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and in conjunction with the White House, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the [Federal Web Council](https://digital.gov/resources/federal-web-council/), the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is issuing guidance for the coordination of Federal web and social media communications related to this incident.

This authority for this action comes from [Emergency Support Function 15](https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/34369) (ESF-15 - Public Affairs – Annex R) of the [National Response Framework](https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/117791) where, during incidents of national significance, DHS has the authority to coordinate all USG communications.

On March 11, 2020, DHS activated ESF-15 for Federal web and social communications to support the national response to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

{{< note >}} **All Federal agencies are required to follow this guidance.** {{< /note >}}

<!-- {{< img src="2871-lores" >}} -->


## In Brief

Federal agencies with a role in the response effort should stand up an `agency.gov/coronavirus` page. That page must contain the following links for the three primary [lanes of communication](#lanes-of-communication):

- [Coronavirus.gov](https://www.coronavirus.gov/) — White House Coronavirus Task Force
- [Coronavirus Disease 2019](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) (COVID-19) — CDC
- [Government Response to Coronavirus](https://www.usa.gov/coronavirus) — USAgov

In addition, use your agency coronavirus page to communicate what your agency is doing to support the response effort and link to [featured content](#content-to-feature) as appropriate. Also follow the [guidance for social media](#social-media-guidance). Coordinate emergency response-related web communications with your [Federal Web Council representative]({{< ref "/resources/federal-web-council.md" >}}).

Link to authoritative information from other government agencies related to your agency mission or ”lane.” Do NOT copy and paste content from other agencies/websites onto your site.

## Content to Feature

The White House, in collaboration with DHS and HHS, encourages agencies to feature the following content on both their agency homepages and coronavirus pages as appropriate.

### Last updated April 1, 2020

- [**Updated: Coronavirus Guidelines for America**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/coronavirus-guidelines-america/) — The White House Coronavirus Task Force has issued an updated version of this document.
- [**Frequently Asked Questions**](https://faq.coronavirus.gov) — An interagency website, organized by the White House Coronavirus Task Force, for definitive information on the public’s most frequently asked questions. The site currently features content from the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of the Treasury, and Small Business Administration.
- [**Small Business Resources**](https://www.coronavirus.gov/smallbusiness/) — The White House Coronavirus Task Force has provided this information on various assistance programs available to small businesses.
- [**FEMA Rumor Control**](https://www.fema.gov/Coronavirus-Rumor-Control) — Helping the public distinguish between rumors and facts regarding the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. A great resource for social media – if you see a rumor, reply back with the correct answer and link to the FEMA Rumor Control page.
- [**FEMA How You Can Help**](https://www.fema.gov/coronavirus/how-to-help) — Learn the best way to donate, volunteer, or provide critical supplies to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Web Guidance

First, when standing up a page on your website specific to COVID-19, please __FOLLOW THE REQUESTED URL STRUCTURE__ to the best of your ability: `https://www.agency.gov/coronavirus`

Second, __STAY IN YOUR LANE__. Only post information directly related to your agency on your agency’s Coronavirus page.

-   Once your agency’s page is live, please __FORWARD THE LINK__ to [usagovemergency@gsa.gov](mailto:usagovemergency@gsa.gov) for inclusion on the “What the U.S. Government is Doing” lane on USA.gov.

-   If you add a significant news release or update to the public, please __FORWARD THE URL OF THE ARTICLE__ to [usagovemergency@gsa.gov](mailto:usagovemergency@gsa.gov)  for inclusion as well.

Third, __LINK TO THE <a href="#lanes-of-communication">PRIMARY LANES OF COMMUNICATION__</a> for the disease.

-   Link to all three lanes <a href="#lanes-of-communication">__(see below)__</a> from all publicly-released materials related to COVID-19.

-   Link to all three lanes prominently on your agency’s Coronavirus page.

-   Link to any (or all) of the three lanes elsewhere on your agency website as appropriate.

-   If your agency has agency-specific coronavirus information (where you “own” that lane), promote that specific information on your homepage BEFORE promoting the three lanes. It doesn’t make sense for [coronavirus.gov](https://www.coronavirus.gov/) or [usa.gov/coronavirus](https://www.usa.gov/coronavirus) to send people your way to have the public be first presented a link back to [coronavirus.gov](https://www.coronavirus.gov/).

-   If your agency does not have agency-specific coronavirus information to present, include a link to [coronavirus.gov](https://www.coronavirus.gov/) on the homepage of your agency website. Prominence of display and additional locations to place the link is at agency discretion and should be based on user analytics (focus on where your users would be looking for this kind of information).

Fourth, at this point, please __DO NOT CREATE A LOGO__ or any other distinct visual treatment for COVID-19. To provide for some level of consistency of presentation, a high-resolution copy of the image that CDC has been using can be found at [https://phil.cdc.gov/Details.aspx?pid=2871](https://phil.cdc.gov/Details.aspx?pid=2871).

## Lanes of Communication

### Coronavirus.gov
[https://www.coronavirus.gov](https://www.coronavirus.gov)

This is a primary lane of information for the public regarding Coronavirus (COVID-19). It is a portal for public information that is curated by the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Task Force at the White House, working in conjunction with CDC, HHS and other agency stakeholders. Coronavirus.gov will link to the appropriate Federal agency website as the authoritative source for that information as necessary.

### Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) landing page on CDC.gov is the latest public health and safety information from CDC and for the overarching medical and health provider community on COVID-19. The site contains consumer and medical information on how the virus spreads, symptoms, prevention and treatment, stigma, cases and what to do if you are sick, along with frequently asked questions.

### What the U.S. Government is Doing
[https://www.usa.gov/coronavirus](https://www.usa.gov/coronavirus)
