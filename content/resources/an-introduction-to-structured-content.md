## What is structured content?

Structured content refers to the concept of organizing and treating digital content like data. Publishing content as modular, discrete pieces of information that are tagged with machine-readable descriptions can transform how people find, understand, share, use, and reuse government information.

## Why is structured content important?

According to [analytics.USA.gov](https://analytics.usa.gov/), most people today use mobile devices to view government websites. Structuring content allows it to be separated from presentation, making information easier to consume on devices with small screens. Content published on static HTML web pages ("unstructured” content) doesn't always adapt well to smaller screens, and it’s harder to discover, share, or reuse.

Structured content gives you granular control over your information, so you can Create Once, Publish Everywhere (known as the COPE model), instead of re-creating similar content for different platforms. 

Search engines use structured content to deliver more meaningful descriptions in search results. The more context and information you provide about your content, the more machine-readable it becomes, enabling web services and search engines to get your content to the people who need it.

Additionally, adding context to content helps all types of predictive algorithms make better predictions for users. It also supports aggregation and reuse of information via Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds, which automatically publish frequently changing information, and [Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)](https://digital.gov/topics/api/), which enable websites, programs, and devices to interact with one another. AI, RSS, and APIs can automate many tasks, and automatically present information. The effectiveness of these technologies is greatly increased by structured content.

As an example, if you publish information about an event as structured content, the same event information could be displayed as part of a calendar of events, or published via a news feed, or aggregated with other related events via an API. A short description of the event could display on the smaller screen of a mobile device, and a longer description could display on a PC. The possibilities are endless, and structured content is your way to leverage all these possibilities.

## How to create structured content

Structure content by adding metadata ("data about data"). Metadata is a way to tag pieces of content with information describing what the content is about. 

Web pages typically consist of several common pieces of information, such as titles, dates, descriptions, or contributors. It’s important to describe things consistently by using a common taxonomy and controlled vocabularies. When you add metadata to your content that consistently identifies and describes each of these elements, you’ve created structured content.

* [DHS Lexicon | Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-lexicon) - The controlled vocabulary DHS uses to consistently define common terms used across the agency.

This approach makes it easier for people to find, understand, and use government information. The key is to think about your content as building blocks, instead of pages.
