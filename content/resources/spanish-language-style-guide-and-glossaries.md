Spanish Language Style Guides are resources for government employees, translators, and communications professionals who work with the government to improve the way we communicate with the public in Spanish. The guide contains information on grammar and style issues as well as glossaries to standardize the use of Spanish across government.

The guides below were peer reviewed by [Leticia Molinero](http://www.anle.us/344/Leticia-Molinero.html), [Maria Cornelio](http://www.anle.us/490/Maria-Cornelio.html) and [Jack Segura](http://www.anle.us/333/Joaquin-Segura.html?sfl=es), members of the North American Academy of the Spanish Language (ANLE). ANLE has [an agreement][6ea313c3] (PDF, 214 kb, 4 pages) with GSA to help improve and standardize the use of the Spanish language in government communications.
