The Spanish Language Style Guide is a resource for government employees, translators, and communications professionals who work with the government to improve the way we communicate with the public in Spanish. The guide contains information on grammar and style issues as well as glossaries to standardize the use of Spanish across government.

The guide was peer reviewed by [Leticia Molinero](http://www.anle.us/344/Leticia-Molinero.html), [Maria Cornelio](http://www.anle.us/490/Maria-Cornelio.html) and [Jack Segura](http://www.anle.us/333/Joaquin-Segura.html?sfl=es), members of the North American Academy of the Spanish Language (ANLE). ANLE has an agreement with GSA to help improve and standardize the use of the Spanish language in government communications.

Please Note: We continue to make improvements to this guide, so please send any comments or suggestions for additional resources to [Laura Godfrey](mailto:laura.godfrey@gsa.gov), Manager, [GobiernoUSA.gov](http://www.usa.gov/gobiernousa/index.shtml).
