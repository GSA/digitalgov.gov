## What is site decommissioning?

When the content of your website has reached a stage where it’s no longer relevant for users, you can choose to either modernize or decommission the site. The justification of this assessment can derive from a variety of factors, including customer value, accuracy of content, technical infrastructure, funding, or relevant law and policy. 

“Decommissioning a website” means taking a website offline. Having a decommissioning plan in place is an important part of your web [governance](https://digital.gov/topics/governance/) strategy. This process often includes removing a site from the web, shutting down the servers that host the website, disabling domain name system (DNS) records that point to the website, and redirecting to a more accurate website.

Consider this decision-making framework when you’re evaluating whether it is time to update, modernize, or decommission a site:

<table class="usa-table">
  <caption>Website decision-making framework</caption>
  <tr>
    <th>**Customer value** - The site is meeting a current customer need, and you have data to validate this.</th>
    <td>Yes / No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Content** - Content on the site is current and accurate.</td>
    <td>Yes / No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Technical infrastructure** - The site’s tech stack meets the latest federal security and technology requirements.</td>
    <td>Yes / No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Funding** - Your team has sufficient resources (funding and staff) to continue supporting the site for the foreseeable future.</td>
    <td>Yes / No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Mandate** - There is a requirement in law or policy for your agency to host the website.</td>
    <td>Yes / No</td>
  </tr>
</table>

If you answered “no” to any of these prompts, it’s probably time to either modernize or decommission the website.

## Why is site decommissioning important?

A website is born out of an idea, or a perception of need. But like any tool or platform, over time the original reason for creating a website either becomes irrelevant, or the codebase of the website itself becomes outdated. Websites are decommissioned when the content is no longer relevant or useful to users or when the technical structure of the site is no longer functional. 

Websites that are out of date make information that is no longer accurate widely available. In some scenarios (such as when health and wellbeing is at stake), this can introduce a great deal of risk and confusion for the public.

If more accurate information is available on a well-maintained website, an outdated, duplicative website can hinder the performance and trustworthiness of the more accurate sites. 

## How to develop a site decommissioning plan

A comprehensive decommissioning plan lays out specific tasks, responsibilities, and timelines to ensure a well-organized transition. Use the framework below to plan for the impact on staff and the public as well as the changes you’ll need to make to existing workflows and processes and how you’ll mitigate potential service disruptions resulting from those changes. 
From start to finish, it can take months to decommission a website. Consider what time of year will have the least impact on customers. Build in a cushion for delays. 

### Step 1. Use analytics to understand the current state

Review website [analytics](https://digital.gov/topics/analytics/) and customer experience metrics. Document the current state of the site against agency mission and customer centricity. Gather analytics on site functionality, performance, and policy compliance. This information will help you show the positive impact of decommissioning.

### Step 2. Audit any content that will be preserved
If you determine that any of the [content](https://digital.gov/topics/content-strategy/) is moving to a new website, ensure that it’s updated, current, and accurate before it’s published on the new site. Don’t automatically migrate everything. Use analytics and customer feedback data to determine which content has value for customers and should be migrated. Then, consult with your [agency’s records officer](https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/agency) and archive or delete the rest, according to your website’s records schedule. 

### Step 3. Make a business case
Analyze the impact of decommissioning on associated operations such as development costs, and data and content management. With the metrics you gathered from determining your baseline, make a document outlining the reasoning behind your decision. Include relevant data, but keep the focus at a high-level. 

Business cases are typically simple documents that readers can quickly get through. You can circulate it to leadership and to your communications and technology teams to help quickly communicate the impact of the decommissioned site — both as it is now and after its eventual removal. 

### Step 4. Draft a timeline
Create a step-by-step schedule for the transition. Include dependencies and critical paths that may impact the schedule. Also, incorporate regular check-ins, and mechanisms for adapting to feedback or unexpected circumstances.

### Step 5. Write a communications plan
Create a comprehensive communications plan for notifying users and customers about the website closure. Provide clear direction to redirect users to other relevant resources as needed.
Schedule time with your communications teams to develop effective messaging.

## How to decommission a site
Follow relevant policies, regulations, laws, and rules related to decommissioning, particularly around records management, including but not limited to:

{{< ring title="Related policy">}}
* [M-23-22 Delivering a digital first public experience](https://digital.gov/resources/delivering-digital-first-public-experience/)
* [NARA guidance on managing web records (January 2005)](https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/policy/managing-web-records-index.html)
* [NARA Bulletin 2014-02: Guidance on managing social media records](https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/bulletins/2014/2014-02.html)
{{/ring}}

Review any existing agreements, to determine what actions you need to take to close those out.
When decommissioning a site, here are some actions you will need to collaborate with your tech support team to accomplish: 
* Update the agency website inventory and any other relevant inventories
* Export relevant records to a backup code repository, in accordance with the site’s records schedule
* Review documented security requirements and protocols (for both external and internal websites)
* Contact Certificate Authorities (CA) to revoke Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates
* Delete the domain
* Implement redirects so that search engines and users who have bookmarked the site don’t get 404 errors
* Decommission any databases
* Change firewall configuration
* Retire each associated application
* Remove backups, archive data, and uninstall system software and accounts
* Conduct system testing for integration, latency, and security
* Remove the system from security scan lists
* Confirm removal of system software, services, and accounts
* Report the site closure to search engines within respective search consoles
* Deactivate the service
* Archive and close code hosting platforms that are publicly or privately available and provide a notice for users
* Ensure complete removal of data
* Verify that decommissioning is complete

## Close out
Conduct an evaluation after decommissioning to gather insights, learn from mistakes, and improve future plans. 
Remember that once a site is decommissioned, your work is not done. Monitor user flows with analytics tools for several months to ensure that no site visitors are left confused or unable to find information that could help them. 
* Send post-decommission notifications to key collaborators
* Conduct post-decommission evaluation and monitoring
* Document lessons learned and share them with others in your agency, through case studies, updated documentation, or other means

## What can I do next?
As a website manager, it can be hard to admit that your website is no longer serving a relevant customer need, or adding real business value, but almost every website will reach the end of its useful life at some point.

Use the decision-making framework and tips in this resource to determine whether it's time to decommission your website. If your answer is yes, define a timeline, responsibilities, and milestones. 

Then, talk with your supervisor to make it happen!
