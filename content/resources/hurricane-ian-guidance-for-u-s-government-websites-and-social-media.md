{{< note "alert" >}} Atlantic hurricane season ended 11/30/2022. This page has been archived. {{< /note >}}

In response to Hurricane Ian, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is issuing guidance for the coordination of Federal web and social media communications related to this incident.

This authority for this action comes from [Emergency Support Function 15](https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/34369) (ESF-15 - Public Affairs – Annex R) of the [National Response Framework](https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/117791) where, during incidents of national significance, DHS has the authority to coordinate all U.S. government communications.

On September 28, 2022, in conjunction with the [Federal Web Council](https://digital.gov/resources/federal-web-council/), DHS activated ESF-15 for Federal web and social communications to support the national response to Hurricane Ian.

{{< note >}} **All Federal agencies are required to follow this guidance.** {{< /note >}}

## In Brief

Federal agencies with a role in the response effort should stand up an `agency.gov/hurricane-ian` or `agency.gov/ian` page. That page should link to the two primary lanes of communication:

1. What DHS and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Are Doing
2. What the U.S. Government Is Doing


{{< note "action" >}}
When distributing materials related to Hurricane Ian, please include links to these two lanes on all materials.

{{< note "action" >}}
When posting information to your agency website, please only post information related to your individual agency. Then, link to the authoritative information from other government agencies that is related to your agency mission or ”lane.” Do NOT copy and paste content from other agencies or websites onto your site.

Coordinate emergency response-related web and digital communications with your [Federal Web Council]({{< ref "/resources/federal-web-council.md" >}}) representative.

FEMA has established a landing page on FEMA.gov with the latest information from FEMA and DHS on the storm. The page is currently promoting response and recovery information and serves as a clearinghouse for related information from DHS. The page is located at [https://www.fema.gov/hurricane-ian](https://www.fema.gov/hurricane-ian) and is available in multiple languages.
