## Call for Presenters

Join us as presenters for the 2021 Government UX Summit — a great opportunity to hone your UX skills with the best and brightest UX researchers and designers from across the government. Our fully virtual event will be held June 22-24, 2021.

Only U.S. government employees (federal, state, tribal, and local) and contractors with a U.S. government email address—and with their agency’s approval—are eligible to present. This is to ensure that the event supports government UX work.

[Submit your proposal](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScH8C3t9vUHLVcMxvUbYL0M_nwk_6-d9HayLS39iFdCdEQMRA/viewform) by February 26, 2021.

A committee of government employees will review the submissions and select the program based on the relevance, usefulness, and quality of the submission and the qualifications of the presenters. We expect to finalize the program in late March.

**Below are the topics and presentation formats that we’re looking for. For more information on requirements for submitting, please contact Jean Fox at [Fox.Jean@bls.gov](mailto:Fox.Jean@bls.gov) or Caroline Smith at [Caroline.Smith@cms.hhs.gov](mailto:Caroline.Smith@cms.hhs.gov).**
