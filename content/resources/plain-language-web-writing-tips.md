<table class="resources__plain-language-table" style="width: 100%" border="1">
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Audience</strong></td><td>Write for your reader. Don&#8217;t write for the experts, the lawyers, or your management, unless they are your intended audience.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Length</strong></td><td><s>Less is more!</s> <s>Be concise.</s> Eliminate ALL unnecessary words. <s>Challenge every word = do you need it?</s></td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Tone</strong></td><td>Use conversational pronouns (you, us, our, we). Write as if you were talking to a colleague or friend. Use contractions (we’re instead of we are).</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Voice</strong></td><td>Use active voice with strong verbs. Say “We mailed your form on May 1” instead of “Your form was mailed by us on May 1.”</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Word Choice</strong></td><td>Use the same words your readers use when they search for your info on the Web. Avoid acronyms and jargon.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Simplify</strong></td><td>Use simple, descriptive section headings; short paragraphs; and ordinary, familiar words.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Links</strong></td><td>Never use &#8220;click here&#8221;—link language should describe what your reader will get if they click that link. Include key words to help search engines.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Organization</strong></td><td>Put the most important information first, followed by the details.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Improve Tasks</strong></td><td>Organize content around your customers’ tasks, not your organization. Highlight action items (step 1, step 2, etc.).</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Scannability</strong></td><td>Separate content into small chunks. Use lots of white space for easy scanning. In general, write no more than 5-7 lines per paragraph. Use lists and bullets, they are easy to scan.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Separate Topics</strong></td><td>Present each topic separately. Keep the information on each page to three (or fewer) levels.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Context</strong></td><td>Don’t assume your readers already know the subject or have read related pages. Each page should stand on its own. Put everything in context.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Test and Evaluate</strong></td><td>Test Web pages with actual customers so you can be sure real people can understand what you write.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Train</strong></td><td>Encourage all your colleagues (lawyers, accountants, researchers, etc.) to use plain language—because all content is potentially Web content.</td>
  </tr>
