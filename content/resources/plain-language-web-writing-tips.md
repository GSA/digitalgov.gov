<table style="width: 100%" border="1">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Audience</strong>
    </td>

    <td>
      Write for your reader. Don&#8217;t write for the experts, the lawyers, or your management, unless they are your intended audience.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Length</strong>
    </td>

    <td>
      <s>Less is more!</s> <s>Be concise.</s> Eliminate ALL unnecessary words. <s>Challenge every word = do you need it?</s>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Tone</strong>
    </td>

    <td>
      Use conversational pronouns (you, us, our, we). Write as if you were talking to a colleague or friend. Use contractions (we’re instead of we are).
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Voice</strong>
    </td>

    <td>
      Use active voice with strong verbs. Say “We mailed your form on May 1” instead of “Your form was mailed by us on May 1.”
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Word Choice</strong>
    </td>

    <td>
      Use the same words your readers use when they search for your info on the Web. Avoid acronyms and jargon.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Simplify</strong>
    </td>

    <td>
      Use simple, descriptive section headings; short paragraphs; and ordinary, familiar words.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Links</strong>
    </td>

    <td>
      Never use &#8220;click here&#8221;—link language should describe what your reader will get if they click that link. Include key words to help search engines.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Organization</strong>
    </td>

    <td>
      Put the most important information first, followed by the details.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Improve Tasks</strong>
    </td>

    <td>
      Organize content around your customers’ tasks, not your organization. Highlight action items (step 1, step 2, etc.).
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Scannability</strong>
    </td>

    <td>
      Separate content into small chunks. Use lots of white space for easy scanning. In general, write no more than 5-7 lines per paragraph. Use lists and bullets, they are easy to scan.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Separate Topics</strong>
    </td>

    <td>
      Present each topic separately. Keep the information on each page to three (or fewer) levels.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Context</strong>
    </td>

    <td>
      Don’t assume your readers already know the subject or have read related pages. Each page should stand on its own. Put everything in context.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Test and Evaluate</strong>
    </td>

    <td>
      Test Web pages with actual customers so you can be sure real people can understand what you write.
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      <strong>Train</strong>
    </td>

    <td>
      Encourage all your colleagues (lawyers, accountants, researchers, etc.) to use plain language—because all content is potentially Web content.
