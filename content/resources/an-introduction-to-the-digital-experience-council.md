## What is the Digital Experience Council?

The Digital Experience (DX) Council was required by M-23-22, Delivering a Digital-First Public Experience, and launched in February 2024 as a subcommittee of the Federal Chief Information Officer’s Council (CIO Council). It plays a critical role in coordinating governmentwide efforts and assisting agencies in delivering digital experiences that meet the public’s needs and expectations.

The Digital Experience Council seeks to:

* **Identify opportunities and provide policy advice** on how to improve the delivery of digital experiences across Federal websites and services.
* **Serve as a source of expertise** on the current and future state of web and digital technologies and how they could be used by the government for [delivering a digital-first public experience](https://digital.gov/resources/delivering-digital-first-public-experience/).
* **Assist in the governmentwide implementation** of 21st Century IDEA, M-23-22, Delivering a Digital-First Public Experience, and other laws and policies.
* **Advise on and inform** the direction and development of governmentwide standards and [shared services](https://digital.gov/services/) related to digital experience.
* **Coordinate web and digital content and communications** across agencies to prevent duplication and ensure coordinated communications during incidents of national significance (in partnership with the Department of Homeland Security and as outlined in the [National Response Framework](https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/national-preparedness/frameworks/response)).
* **Provide a venue for digital leaders and the broader community to collaborate** on best practices, lessons learned, and common approaches to digital experience challenges.
* **Sponsor on-going external collaboration** with industry, state and local governments, and other external parties to identify opportunities to strengthen collaboration.
