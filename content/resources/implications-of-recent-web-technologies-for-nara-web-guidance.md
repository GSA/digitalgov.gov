This document explores some of the [emerging web applications and their impact on records management](http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/initiatives/web-tech.html).

In its early days, the web was seen largely as a place to post static documents that were Internet-accessible. More recently, it is seen as a tool for facilitating collaboration across geographic and institutional boundaries. This document examines four applications that create content likely to exist only on the web.

- Web-portals
- Blogs
- Wikis
- RSS

Agencies must continue to manage content created via these applications in compliance with NARA&#8217;s records management guidance, including its Web Management and Transfer Policies.
