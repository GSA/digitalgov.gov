The two most important principles to adhere to when building a new digital product are ‘work smaller’ and ‘validate your ideas.’ These two concepts are at the heart of [10x](https://10x.gsa.gov/) — a technology investment program that funds new ideas that help the government deliver better products and services.

[The 10x process](https://10x.gsa.gov/the-10x-process/) counters traditional government funding practices where investments are typically large and require a full project plan before funding is granted. 10x is modeled after modern venture capital practices that use small, gated investments and allow projects the flexibility to become more focused and prevent massive sunk costs as the idea matures. This approach is designed to spend fewer taxpayer dollars while also ensuring the best products and services are funded.

There are four key phases that a 10x project could progress through — investigation, discovery, development, and scale — and at the end of each phase, project teams either justify continued investment or recommend that the work stop.

10x firmly believes that the best ideas often come from the people who work closest to the public — so, anyone in the federal government is invited to submit project ideas to 10x.
