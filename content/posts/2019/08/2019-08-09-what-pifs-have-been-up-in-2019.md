Across the federal government, [Presidential Innovation Fellows](https://www.presidentialinnovationfellows.gov/) (PIF) are helping to streamline regulations, increase engagement with private sector investors, and deploy pioneering machine learning and natural language processing solutions.

As part of the [President's Management Agenda](https://www.performance.gov/PMA/PMA.html) (PMA), PIFs are working on the [Cross Agency Priority (CAP) Goal number 4](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/cx/) on governmentwide customer experience (CX). This work—across 24 federal agencies—is to design the data infrastructure necessary to create the first public-facing dashboards on citizen experience. At the [U.S. Department of Transportation](https://www.transportation.gov/) (DOT), they are helping unlock the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous systems while designing for a future transportation ecosystem. 

We’ve seen several of our fellows get awards and recognition, such as the 2019 Service to the Citizen Award, the Fed 100, and the DCFemTech award—which two fellows received for their work in data and design. We’ve seen a PIF promoted to a leadership position in the [Centers of Excellence](https://coe.gsa.gov/) (CoE) within the [Technology Transformation Services](https://www.gsa.gov/tts) (TTS), helping usher in a future of federal leadership with human-centered design. And this month, one of our fellows, was named to be the Director of Artificial Intelligence at the [VA Office of Research and Development](https://www.research.va.gov/) (VA Research). 

To understand agencies, our fellows have traveled [across the nation](https://18f.gsa.gov/2019/07/16/on-the-road-to-innovation/) to solve regional technology challenges, and globally to Prague to meet with stakeholders at the front lines of global media. From San Diego to South Carolina, fellows have visited national labs, hospitals, call centers, and claim processing centers for a holistic view of end-to-end business lines and operations. Along the way, they’ve even been to the [National Aeronautics and Space Administration](https://www.nasa.gov/)'s Wallops Flight Facility ([NASA Wallops](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/wallops/home/)) to watch the launch of a spacecraft. 

The PIF journey is a tested one. For seven years, fellows have been catalysts in American innovation. We are now creating tools to quantify the impact of innovation. At the program level, we have piloted an interactive Storybank that allows our fellows to capture internal learnings about their work. Similar to a weekly diary, the learnings are giving us better insight into some of the advances, blockers, and collaborations happening across 24 agencies.
