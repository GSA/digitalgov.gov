This week, President Obama will [travel to SxSW (South by Southwest)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/03/05/weekly-address-sxsw) to talk about how we can use technology to tackle tough challenges. This underscores how important data—government data, in particular—is to improving and fueling our democracy forward. 2015 saw many [open data milestones](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/02/05/open-data-empowering-americans-make-data-driven-decisions) by agencies, including:

  * [New advancements in HHS’s syndication storefront]({{< relref "2015-12-21-with-collaboration-comes-great-things.md" >}})
  * New features to [analytics.usa.gov]({{< relref "2015-12-01-analytics-usa-gov-new-features-and-more-data.md" >}}) dashboard (now with [agency-specific dashboards]({{< relref "2016-02-18-analytics-usa-gov-now-with-agency-specific-dashboards.md" >}})

There is also more to come (and more that’s needed). This month on DigitalGov we’ll take a look at what else agencies are working on, including:

  * How a [new agency addition to DAP impacts analytics.usa.gov]({{< relref "2016-03-22-the-postal-service-just-broke-analytics-usa-gov.md" >}})

  * A look at the [mobile development community&#8217;s debate]({{< relref "2016-03-09-the-data-briefing-mobile-websites-or-mobile-apps-or-both.md" >}}) over mobile apps vs. mobile websites
