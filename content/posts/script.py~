# If we can access the filename, we can use regex to add the proper `url:` format in the front matter.
# Do you know if there is a way we can access the filename as a variable in a find and replace?


# The files in the /content/posts/ folder are what need to be modified.
# https://github.com/GSA/digitalgov.gov/tree/demo/content/posts
# The root of the repo is here: https://github.com/GSA/digitalgov.gov

# You can either download the repo, modify just the files in the /content/posts/, or you can check out the repo, make the changes an push them up in a new branch.
