## Is your site organized such that everyone can navigate it easily?

**Why it’s important**: Beth has a lower tech literacy level and needs a site’s layout to be clear. Julian has low vision and uses a screen reader to navigate the web. Kendra has a newborn and her attention is often divided; she needs to be able to understand a site’s contents at a glance. Lyle is undergoing a crisis and needs to quickly find just the content pertinent to him.

### Steps to take
- Write descriptive page titles. Users who rely on assistive technologies like screen readers may not be able to use visual cues to determine a page’s purpose. Make sure your page titles concisely convey each page’s focus.
- Make sure users can navigate a site in multiple ways. Some strategies include providing a table of contents, providing a sitemap, linking between pages, and including sitewide search.
- Indicate changes in language (for example, when including a foreign word in a predominantly English text). This will help people using screen readers, people with cognitive disabilities, and folks using braille translation software to fully understand your content.
- Use a screen reader or simulator to make sure you can land on controls and that they’re announcing things as they should.
- Determine whether the HTML document has a language attribute so that screen readers will read it with the correct accent and pronunciation. For example: `<html lang="en">`. (Note: If you’re not comfortable taking this step, feel free to ask another designer on your project team to help.)
- If forms are present, make sure the screen reader reads labels and instructions.
