## Is there enough contrast between text and its background color?

**Why it’s important**: Esther has low vision and needs content to have enough contrast to read it. Joel is red-green colorblind and can’t make sense of information conveyed with color alone.

### Steps to take
- Use a [color contrast](http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) tool and test that the contrast between the text and background is greater than or equal to 4.5:1.
- Use an [automated tool]({{ site.baseurl }}/automated-testing/) to quickly scan for color contrast problems.
- Don’t use color alone to convey meaning. Use icons, text, and other visual elements to reinforce the meaning of the content.
