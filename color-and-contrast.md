## Is there enough contrast between text and its background color?

**Why it’s important**: Joel is red/green colorblind and can’t see the difference between some shades. Esther has low vision and needs content to have enough contrast to read it.

### How
- Use a color contrast tool and test that the contrast between the text and background is greater than or equal to 4.5:1.
- Use an automated tool (below) to see if color contrast is indicated as a problem.
- You’re not using only color to convey meaning, but accompanying it with icons and text too.
