### Steps to take
- Consider defining technical or other potentially unfamiliar terms in line; this creates a much more continuous reading experience for the user.
- If you find that you need to define a large number of terms within your content, consider adding a separate glossary page.
- Use hyperlinks or a tooltip rather than footnotes to direct users to definitions. Footnotes can create a jarring reading experience, and they may not render correctly on mobile devices.
