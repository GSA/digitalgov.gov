## Learn the basics of accessibility and what your team does to make content accessible.

### Steps to take
- Familiarize yourself with the high-level accessibility roles for each member of your team:
  - [Front end / dev](/front-end/getting-started/): Ensure front-end code is written accessibly and conducts manual and automated testing.
  - [Content design](content-design/getting-started/): Ensure content is written in plain language and headings, images, and links are accurately labeled.
  - [Visual design](/visual-design/getting-started/): Ensure that designs are accessible, pages are laid out in a logical order, and content meets color contrast requirements.
  - [UX design](/): Ensure that overall experience is built and designed in an accessible fashion, conduct usability testing with people who need accessibility features.
- Ensure your team members know where to find the accessibility guidelines for their role and follow them from the start of a project. The guides are located here: [front end](/front-end/getting-started/), [content design](/content-design/getting-started/), and [visual design](/visual-design/getting-started/).
- Take an Accessibility 101 class, such as [Udacityâ€™s Web Accessibility class](https://www.udacity.com/course/web-accessibility--ud891), to get a baseline knowledge of accessibility.
- Learn how to [navigate a webpage using only your keyboard](/visual-design/keyboard-access/) and [learn how to use VoiceOver](/visual-design/screen-reader/) so you can spot check new features when necessary.
