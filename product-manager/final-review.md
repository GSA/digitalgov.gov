## Request a final review from an accessibility expert.

### Steps to take
- In most cases, you may [request a manual accessibility review](https://github.com/18F/Accessibility_Reviews) from the Accessibility guild at least two weeks before a public launch. This ensures there’s enough time to conduct the review and make necessary changes. Ideally, you’ve been manually testing throughout the project and this should be quick. This review will be billed to the project.
- Depending on your project’s requirements, you may also choose to hire an outside firm to conduct testing as part of your QA.
