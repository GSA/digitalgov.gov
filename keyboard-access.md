## Can you reach anything that’s interactive using the tab key?
**Why it’s important**: Maria has tendonitis and is unable to use a mouse, she uses the keyboard to navigate the web.
### How
- Tab through your experience
- Use the keyboard to navigate through the page using the tab key
- You can reach all interactive elements and trigger them with a spacebar or enter key
- Focus is always visible and appears in logical order
- No content gets focused offscreen and hidden
- A skip navigation link is provided if navigation is present before the main content, allowing you to skip past navigation to reach the page’s main content.
