## Development Guide

### Technologies you should be familiarize yourself with

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) - The primary site engine that builds digital.gov code and content.
- [Front Matter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter#readout) - The top of each page/post includes keywords within `---` tags. This is meta data that helps Hugo build the site, but you can also use it to pass custom variables.
- [U.S. Web Design System v 2.0](https://v2.designsystem.digital.gov) - the design system used in digital.gov.
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) - the asset pipeline.

### Installation

#### Prerequisites
Install [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) globally from your terminal command line:
```
npm install gulp-cli -g
```

To use Gulp, you must have [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) installed.
We're currently using Node v10.16.3. A recommended way of changing your Node version is to use a node version manager tool like [`n`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n) to quickly change between node versions.

NPM is package along with Node. Check your versions of these in your terminal command line by typing:
```
node -v
npm -v
```

Using [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/) is a quick and easy way to install Hugo. [Install Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) before getting started.

#### Install Hugo 0.66.0

[Read the HUGO quickstart guide »](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)

**[For OSX](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#install-hugo-with-brew):**
`brew install hugo`
_see https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/ for other OSs_

Quickly check your Hugo version at your terminal command line by running:
```
hugo version
```

**Note:** Digital.gov currently uses Hugo version 0.66.0. This is noted in our [.hugo-version](.hugo-version) file.
If Hugo has released a new version, but digital.gov hasn't been upgraded to that version, you may get errors when building locally. It is possible to use Homebrew to download a previous version of Hugo. To do that follow these instructions: [Using Legecy Versions of the Hugo Static Site Generator](https://www.fernandomc.com/posts/brew-install-legacy-hugo-site-generator/)

#### Setup

Once the prerequisites are installed, [clone the repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to your local machine. Then navigate to the project folder in your terminal and run:

```
npm install
```

This will install all of the Node dependencies needed to run your Hugo environment. This may take a little while!

#### Local Development

Running the local development server is as simple as running:

```
npm start
```

NPM will run the following scripts:

- `gulp env` — sets the environment variable to development (local builds only, not in Federalist)
- `gulp` — builds and compresses all of the SCSS and JS files, and copies jquery and uswds js from `node_modules` and puts them in the `/dist/` folder.
- `gulp Watch` — starts a watch task to look for changes in the SCSS and JS files
- `hugo serve` — builds all of the pages in hugo and creates a local server at `http://localhost:1313/`


When Hugo is done building, you should see a success message like:
```
Web Server is available at //localhost:1313/ (bind address 127.0.0.1)
Press Ctrl+C to stop
```

You may then view your local site in the browser at `http://localhost:1313/`.

Local development is powered by BrowserSync, to allow rapid development through:

- A local development server at `http://localhost:1313/`.
- Automatic CSS & JS updates without reloading the page
- Automatic page reloads when content is changed


### Configuration
#### Environment Variables
This project uses environment variables to handle uploading of images to AWS (powered by Gulp scripts).

In your command line terminal run `cp env.example .env` to create a template .env file in the root directory of the project.

Replace “[your key goes here]” in the .env file with your AWS key.

#### Asset Pipeline

_NOTE: This is now included in the `npm start` command above_

All style and image build tasks are handled by [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/javascript-and-gulpfiles) and are located in `gulpfile.js`. All parts of the build are configurable in discrete files (located in config/gulp) to make management easy.

Starting the gulp watch tasks to compile styles. This can be done in the terminal command line by running:

```
gulp
```
You would want to have the Hugo build running along with a `gulp` session in separate terminal sessions in order to compile and watch both content and style changes.

**Tip:** Use the keyboard shortcut `control + c` to stop the gulp watch process.

### Images
Images found in `content/images/inbox/` will be optimized and compressed and sent to an AWS S3 bucket for usage in your layouts and content. This is done by running the `gulp img` command. See the digital.gov wiki for [how to process images](https://github.com/GSA/digitalgov.gov/wiki/Adding-Images).


**Other helpful HUGO commands:**

- `hugo build` — builds all the pages in the site, without creating a server
- `hugo serve` — builds all of the pages in hugo and creates a local server at `http://localhost:1313/`
- `hugo serve --templateMetricsHints` — for seeing where you can apply caching in templates and speed up the build time
[See more in the Hugo docs »](https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo/)

## Upgrading Hugo

1. Read through [the recent releases](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases)
2. Run `brew upgrade hugo` to upgrade your local copy ([docs](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#upgrade-hugo)).
1. Set the version in the `.hugo-version` file. This is only used for telling Federalist which version of Hugo they should checkout and use.

## Accessibility tests

We follow the WCAG2AA standard, and one of the ways we check that we're following the right rules is through automated tools, like [**pa11y**](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y/). For more info on the rules being tested checkout the [pa11y wiki](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y/wiki/HTML-CodeSniffer-Rules).

### Running tests

To run a web accessibility test on digital.gov do the following:

1. Check out the site from GitHub https://github.com/GSA/digitalgov.gov/
1. Install and run the site locally following the `Install` and `Run` instructions above. *Site must be running locally to perform the scan.*
  - If this is your first time running pa11y, then you'll need to run `npm install` to make sure pa11ly is installed.
2. In a separate terminal window, run `npm run test:pa11y` to initiate the accessibility checker.

*Note*: Currently, this only runs accessiblity checks on the site home page as a Proof of Concept demonstration.

Accessibility testing configuration is located in the .pa11yci file.


## Common Regex scripts

### convert legacy-img to standard img

```
{{< legacy-img src="/\d+/\d+/\d{2,4}[-x]+\d{2,4}[_-]*(.+?)\.[pngje]+"( alt=".+?")* >}}
```
```
{{< img src="$1"$2 >}}
```

### convert CDN links
```
{{< legacy-img src="/(\d{4,4})
{{< legacy-img src="$1
```

### replace `url` with `slug` in posts
```
^url: .+/([^/]+)\.md
slug: $1
```
