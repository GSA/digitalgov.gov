## Consider how everyone will use the product.

### Steps to take
- Don’t assume that your users don’t have accessibility needs. Even if your product serves a small subset of users, any one individual may experience situational (working in a loud environment) or temporary disabilities (having an arm in a cast), or develop a more permanent one.
- Consider inclusion in your research and usability testing with people across a range of ages, races, locations, devices, interests, abilities, languages, English proficiency, gender orientations, and access to reliable internet.
- Consider testing your product with people in their own context, such as people who use alternative reading devices, have color blindness impairments, or motor impairments.
- Set a regular cadence for testing accessibility scenarios.
