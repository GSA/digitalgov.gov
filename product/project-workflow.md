## Build accessibility into your project workflow rather than retrofitting it at the end.

### Steps to take
- Encourage the team to account for accessibility when creating and estimating stories.
- Add accessibility as an acceptance criteria or definition of done for each story or new feature.
- Add accessibility testing into each development sprint or QA check.
- Work with your front end developers to choose an [automated testing plan]({{ site.baseurl }}/front-end/automated-testing/).
  - Including automated accessibility testing throughout the development process can help quickly catch [many accessibility errors](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2017/02/24/what-we-found-when-we-tested-tools-on-the-worlds-least-accessible-webpage/), but can’t guarantee that your site is accessible. Always combine automated testing with ongoing manual testing.
- When a new accessibility issue arises that you may have missed, prioritize those issues appropriately against other development concerns:
  - Consider whether the error is [critical, less critical, or minor](https://pages.18f.gov/accessibility/checklist/).
    - Critical issues will cause serious problems and/or stop most users of assistive technology from using the site.
    - Less critical issues may cause problems or increased frustration for certain users.
    - Minor issues will cause problems or frustration for a small number of users.
  - Consider prioritizing the issue if it appears on high-touch pages, critical user paths, or site-wide templates.
