## How to use this guide

- We recommend conducting accessibility testing throughout the design and development processes.
- A good place to start testing is on high-touch pages, critical user paths, and site-wide templates.
- If you have project-specific questions, ask the Accessibility Guild in [#g-accessibility](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/g-accessibility/).
