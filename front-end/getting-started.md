## Accessibility for front-end developers

Accessible front-end development ensures people with different abilities can access, understand, and navigate web content, regardless of how they're accessing it. Front-end developers collaborate with other members of a cross-functional team to implement a robust user experience.

### How to use this guide

- We recommend conducting accessibility testing throughout the design and development processes.
- A good place to start testing is on high-touch pages, critical user paths, and site-wide templates.
- If you have project-specific questions, ask your agencyâ€™s accessibility team.
