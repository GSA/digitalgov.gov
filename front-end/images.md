question: Do images have good alt text?
personas:
- Carmen’s page didn’t load all the way and didn’t get to download the images. 
- Amanda is blind and has to read the alt text to understand the contents of the image. 
- John is looking for information with a search engine and needs help being directed to the right content (descriptive alt tags will improve search).

### Steps to take
- Include meaningful information describing each image in the alt text.
- Use null (empty) alt text when text describing the image is already on the page (`alt=""`).
- Don’t start the alt text with _Image of_ or _Photo of_ – the screen reader already announces that images are images.
- If the image is decorative and you don’t want the screen reader to announce it at all, use null (empty) alt text (`alt=""`) or CSS background images.
