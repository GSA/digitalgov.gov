The link can be an internal hugo page or external website.

If an external link is used then all fields in the shortcode are required.

See themes/digital.gov/layouts/partials/core/featured-resource.html for more implementation details

@params {string} title - if link is external the title will need to be provided
@params {string} link - path to resource such as "/guides/dap" or "https://www.ai.gov"
@params {string} summary - if link is external the summary will need to be provided
@params {string} kicker - optional custom kicker for internal or external links
  
@example with internal link:
{{< featured-resource link = "/guides/dap/" kicker = "kicker to display">}}
@example with external link:
{{< featured-resource link = "https://www.ai.gov" kicker = "Visit ai.gov" title = "Check out ai.gov" summary = "ai.gov is the go to reference for all artifical intelligence in the federal government" >}}
