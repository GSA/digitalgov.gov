Three people in the first photo and one person in the second photo hold different emoji faces of various designs and colors in their hands. The hand-held emojis were created for an interactive engagement experience so that participants could vote on data dashboard effectiveness at the Presidential Innovation Fellows workspace in Washington, DC."
