  alt      :  "This example of a persona created by the National Archives and Records Administration is for a museum visitor named Olivia. On the left, the persona lists three frustrations about not being able to find the information she needs, three desired website features with bars to indicate what level of importance they have for her, her level of technical expertise, and three kinds of computer and mobile devices that she uses. On the right, it states her main goal of seeing the U.S. Constitution, a list of user stories of related tasks that she'd like to be able to do at the museum, and it ends with a quote. At the bottom left is the NARA logo, full name of the agency, and a URL to find additional user personas."
