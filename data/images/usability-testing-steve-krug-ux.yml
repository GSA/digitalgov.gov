Below in black text, says: Watch our 90-minute demonstration and talk with Steve Krug, where he will share how you can get started making usability fixes, no matter what your full-time job is. In the bottom left corner, is the blue Digital.gov logo which consists of three ribbons joined together in an hexagon to resemble the shape of a capital letter D, followed by the domain and program name in black bold text, Digital.gov."
