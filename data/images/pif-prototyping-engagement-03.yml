alt      : "A few desktop design templates and a black marker fill most of the photo. The top sheet shows a sketch of a desktop dashboard concept. Along the top of the paper, it reads, \"My problem or opportunity is: ,\" and leaves space for someone to write in the answer. Below that are two black laptop icons. A small one on the left has a web page and mouse pointer on the screen, with two hand icons below it. On the right, is a large laptop icon that had an empty space for the screen. Below it, reads, \"How might we communicate with it with data?\" Two arrows point up toward the large laptop. A participant has added six sections of text and icons to the screen space: Net Promoter Score, Agency stories, Impact on community outcomes, Before and After graphs, financial Gains to date, and Team and Collaborations."
