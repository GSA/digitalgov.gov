alt      : "The civilrights.justice.gov homepage features a collage representing the history of civil rights and the diversity of people of people in the United States, with historical images of civil rights leaders like Martin Luther King Jr., Dolores Huerta, and crowds at famous protests on the left, blending into modern photographs of people representing an array of racial, ethnic, age, size, disability, LGBTQ, and varying religious identities. Text on top of the images describes how the department upholds the civil rights of all people in the United States. There is a button to submit a report using an online form if you believe your civil rights, or someone elseâ€™s, have been violated. Below there is a link to learn more about your rights."
