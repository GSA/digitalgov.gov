alt      : "A screen capture of the bilingual Move Your Way Activity Planner website in English shows the first nine of more than 50 aerobic and strength-training activities that are available in the Planner. The user has options to personalize activity settings, filter activities by type. On the right, are reminders that users should aim for 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity and 2 days of muscle-strengthening activity each week. Also on the right is a Review your week button--which is inactive until a user sets up their plan."
