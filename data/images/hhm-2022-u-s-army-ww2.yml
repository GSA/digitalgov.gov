alt      : "My grandfather was the first in his family born in the United States. He served overseas in the U.S. Army during World War II as a sergeant but this photo of him in uniform was taken shortly after he enlisted. He and my grandmother met at a United Service Organizations (USO) event after the war, and the rest, as they say, is history."
