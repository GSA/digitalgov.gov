  caption  :  "This image shows how the design changes as the team receives feedback on the proposed design. After each feedback round, the team makes changes to the design to reflect the needs expressed by the participants. Important to note: the changes should be to the details, not the core concept, of the design. If changes to the core concept of the design appear to be needed, the team should consult their discovery phase findings once again, and restart their design phase."
