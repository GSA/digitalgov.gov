alt      : "This is a photo of me as a baby with my grandpa in 1987. We are both smiling as he plays the guitarr√≥n and I try to dance. In addition to serving in the U.S. Army Reserve and working in civil service until retirement, my grandpa was a mariachi. He played a number of string instruments and sang in mariachi bands at large formal events, religious services, and tourist attractions well into his 80s until he passed away from COVID-19 complications in 2020."
