It shows that all six participants started by clicking Getting Started (on the left with a dark blue bar), one participant started by clicking Reporting (on the left with a medium orange bar), and four participants started by clicking Reporting Resources (on the left also with a medium orange bar). Of the six participants who started with Getting Started (represented by medium blue fills between Getting Started on the left and their destination on the right), one selected Getting Started Home (on the right with a dark blue bar), 1 selected New Reporter Checklists (on the right with a light blue bar), and four selected System Access (on the right with a dark orange bar). The one participant who started with Reporting (represented by light orange fill) selected Production (on the right with a dark green bar). Of the four participants who selected Reporting Resources (represented with light orange fills between Reporting Resources on the left and their destination on the right), one selected Reference Lists & Codes (on the right with a light green bar), one selected Reporting Contacts (on the right with a medium orange bar), and two selected Forms (on the right with a red bar). Includes an analysis note that says some participants associated this with getting started and some with forms and that it should be included in both places."
