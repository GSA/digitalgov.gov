Along the top are buttons for home, and seven bill denominations ($1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100) that users can select and explore. Four elements on the back of a $1 bill are circled in white. In the lower right corner is an illustration of Buck the Time-Traveling Dog who guides the user on a quest through the historical events illustrated on the back of U.S. currency."
