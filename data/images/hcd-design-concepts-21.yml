  caption  : "This four-phase diagram shows the Human-Centered Design process. The four phases shown in the circles are: discovery, design, deliver, and measure. These phases are sequential with the expectation that the process as a whole will be cyclical. Each part builds on and references each other, and teams can revisit previous phases as they find the need or investigate different aspects of their project."
  alt      : "Four circles indicate the four phases of Human Centered Design: discovery, design, delivery, and measurement. Arrows connect these circles to indicate that the process is also cyclical, and steps need to be repeated at different phases. The delivery phase is highlighted."
