  alt      : "A compilation of four images. The first is a line drawing of two people talking to each other with stars around them. The next is a logo that uses a sun-like form that seems like it might be quite happy and optimistic. The third is just the words 'I'm walking on sunshine,' but in a font that looks happy and fat, sort of like itâ€™s written in toothpaste. And the fourth is a photo of a beach on a sunny day, which many people associate with happiness."
