## Can you understand the overall trend of the graph? Can you quickly grasp the relationship between parts of the data?

**Why it’s important**: Kwame has trouble reading graphs with small text.

### Steps to take
- Follow data visualization best practices: allow the data and your communication goals for the visualization to dictate the format and visual style, instead of the latest aesthetic trend.
- Support the visuals with a brief description of the overall trend that’s generated by the chart to give context.
- Ensure the data and variables are clearly labeled.
- Make sure there’s sufficient contrast between graph colors so people with color blindness can distinguish the colors.
- Consider complementing the graph with a table of information so that it can be read more easily by screen reader users and when compressed to mobile.
