### Steps to take
- Make sure all graphics have descriptive captions written in plain language.
- Avoid using graphics when written content could communicate the same thing.
- Use icons as helpful visual cues to connect to concepts. Only use icons purposefully and not for decoration. Use familiar icons that people are accustomed to associating with common actions, like a trash can to represent deleting something.
- To use text over images, add a solid background behind the text or a dark overlay to the image.
