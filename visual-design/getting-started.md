## Accessibility for visual design

Everyone benefits from designs that are easier to see. People with different visual abilities see your designs in varying ways—the diverse nature of impairments creates a wide variation in how your designs are perceived. A clean and clear visual presentation helps everyone make sense of a website's information and functionality.

### How to use this guide

We recommend planning for accessibility in your design process and regularly conducting accessibility testing throughout the design and development processes.
