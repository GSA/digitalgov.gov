## How to use this guide

Everyone benefits from designs that are easier to see. People with different visual abilities see your designs in varying waysâ€”the diverse nature of impairments creates a wide variation in how your designs are perceived. By designing with accessibility in mind, you can ensure your designs are easier for everyone to see.

We recommend planning for accessibility in your design process and regularly conducting accessibility testing throughout the design and development processes.

If you have project-specific questions, ask the Accessibility Guild in [#g-accessibility](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/g-accessibility/).
