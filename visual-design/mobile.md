### Steps to take
- Make sure you can reach primary actions easily with either right or left thumbs.
- Make touch targets at least 48px. This will allow the target to be tapped by the average adult finger pad, which measures 10mm. The icons may be smaller and you can work with your developer to extend padding past the icon.
- In most cases, touch targets are separated by 8px of space or more to ensure users don't select the wrong action.
