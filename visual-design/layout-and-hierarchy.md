### Steps to take
- Make sure key information is discernable at a glance. Design minimally and intentionally so that the user can get as much info as quickly as possible.
- Create a clear hierarchy of importance by placing items on the screen according to their relative level of importance. For example, place important actions at the top or bottom of the screen (reachable with shortcuts).
- Plan heading structure early. Ensure all content and design fits into a logical heading structure.
- Consider reading order. The reading order should be the same as the visual order.
- Group related items in proximity to one another to help those who have low vision or trouble focusing on the screen.
