## Are you using accurate headings on your page?

**Why it’s important**: Abby is blind and navigates pages by jumping to the heading of the section of content she’s interested in reading.

### How
- There’s only one `h1` per page and it’s reserved for the page title
- Headings `h2`-`h6` are used in descending order and do not skip heading levels
- Headings restart to `h2` in new sections
<p class="usa-text-small">*While HTML5 allows you to reset headings to H1 on new section elements, some screen reader users will have difficulty discerning the structure of the page with multiple H1's.</p>
