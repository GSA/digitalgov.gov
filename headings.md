## Are you using accurate headings on your page?

**Why it’s important**: Abby is blind and navigates pages by jumping to the heading of the section of content she’s interested in reading.

### Steps to take
- Use `h1`–`h6` to define your section headings, where `h1` is the highest section level and `h6` is the lowest.
- Avoid skipping heading levels: Always start with `h1`, use `h2` next, and so on.
- Use only one `h1` per page for the page title.
<p class="usa-text-small">*While HTML5 allows you to reset headings to h1 on new section elements, some screen reader users will have difficulty discerning the structure of pages with multiple h1s. For this reason, it’s best to include only one h1 per page.</p>
