# Image and File Upload Processing

This set of scripts provides functionality for uploading, processing, and managing images and files in a web application. The scripts work together to handle various tasks such as file normalization, image resizing, file uploading to Amazon S3, and generating necessary metadata files.

## Overview

The image and file upload processing feature consists of the following scripts:

1. `file-prep.js`: Prepares the uploaded files by normalizing filenames, creating necessary directories, and generating YAML metadata files.

2. `file-process.js`: Processes the uploaded images by creating responsive variants and compressing the original image.

3. `upload.js`: Uploads the processed images and files to Amazon S3 and cleans up temporary directories.
> [!NOTE]
> This script is derived from typescript code located in ./config/typescript/upload.ts. 

If you want to make edits to this code you must recompile the javascript for upload.js, run the following command from the root directory.

```shell
npm i -g typescript
```  

Then run this: 
```
tsc config/typescript/upload.ts --outDir config/gulp 
```

4. `scripts.js`: Bundles and compiles JavaScript files using webpack.

5. `styles.js`: Compiles SASS stylesheets, copies USWDS fonts and images, and generates SVG sprites.

## Usage

To use the image and file upload processing feature, follow these steps:

1. Place the uploaded images and files in the designated upload directory (`content/uploads/_inbox`).

2. Run the `npx gulp upload` command to execute the entire upload process, including file preparation, image processing, and uploading to Amazon S3.

The `gulp upload` command will perform the following steps:
- Normalize filenames, create necessary directories, and generate YAML metadata files.
- Process the uploaded images by creating responsive variants and compressing the original image.
- Upload the processed images and files to Amazon S3.
- Clean up temporary directories.

## Configuration

- The upload directories and file paths can be configured in the `filePaths` object in `file-prep.js`.
- The variant settings for image resizing can be modified in the `variantSettings` object in `file-process.js`.
- The Amazon S3 bucket and credentials should be configured in the `.env` file and `file-upload.js`.

## Dependencies

The scripts rely on the following dependencies:

- `gulp`: Task runner for automating build processes.
- `sharp`: Image processing library for resizing and compressing images.
- `aws-sdk` and `gulp-awspublish`: Libraries for uploading files to Amazon S3.
- `webpack` and related plugins: Tools for bundling and compiling JavaScript files.
- `sass` and related plugins: Tools for compiling SASS stylesheets.

Make sure to install the required dependencies before running the scripts.

## Notes

- The scripts assume a specific directory structure and naming conventions. Modifying the paths and settings will break the upload process.
- Ensure that the necessary permissions and credentials are properly configured for accessing Amazon S3.
