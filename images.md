## Do images have good alt text?

**Why it’s important**: Carmen’s page didn’t load all the way and didn’t get to download the images. Amanda is blind and has to read the alt text to understand the contents of the image.

### Steps to take
- Images with meaningful information use alt text to describe the image
- When text describing the image is on the page, an empty alt attribute is used on the image
- “Image of” and “Photo of” do not precede the alt text because the screen reader already announces it’s an image.
- Decorative images are ignored by a screen reader by using empty alt text `(alt="")` or CSS background images.
