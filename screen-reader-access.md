## Can you use a screen reader to access the page content?

### Why it’s important
Jerry is blind and uses a screenreader to navigate the web.

### How
- Use a screen reader to make sure you can land on controls and they’re announcing things as they should.
- If forms are present, labels and instructions are read.

Use VoiceOver screen reader on Mac:

[...]

<button>Yes</button>
<button class="usa-button-secondary">No</button>
<button class="usa-button-outline" type="button">Skip >></button>
